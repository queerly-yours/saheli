            Ilina’s life and work were dedicated to making meaningful linkages between
                women’s movements challenging patriarchal oppression, and peoples’
                movements struggling for livelihood, as well as the sustainability of natural
                resources of jal, jangal and zameen. For many years, Ilina chose to be with
                marginalised and oppressed communities and workers in the political battle
                for their rights, but also to live with and learn from them. She taught adivasi
                children, was integral part of public health movements, trade unions, human
                rights and adivasi/tribal organisations. Her pathbreaking work, A Space
                Within the Struggle – Women’s Participation in People’s Struggles chronicles
                the struggles of brick workers, landless labourers, fishworkers, etc., people
                who still often remain invisible to the discipline of women’s studies; and
                continues to be a pioneering work on understanding women’s participation
                in people’s struggles and their fight to bring women’s perspectives to these
                struggles.
            </p>
            <p>Ilina's later work Sukhwasin: The Migrant Woman of Chhattisgarh on
                the issue of migration out of Chhattisgarh due to drought, famine and hunger,
                threw special light on the conditions of migrant women. Thus, long before she
                joined the Gender Studies Departments in Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya
                Hindi University, Wardha, and later the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, and
                becoming President, Indian Association of Women Studies, she was writing
                and thinking about the intersectionality of struggles.
            </p>
            <p>Ilina’s soft demeanor concealed her firm resolve to fight for justice. Her
                personal and political struggles became inextricably intermeshed when her
                husband and fellow activist Binayak Sen was arrested and charged with the
                UAPA. She fought relentlessly, not just for his release but also against the
                abysmal conditions and overcrowding in Indian prisons. Despite failing health,
                she never faltered in her determination to resist anti-people public health
                and development policies, attempts to quash dissent, rampant human rights’
                violations, laws against sedition, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
            The sweetness with which Ilina would render songs of women’s and peoples’
            rights movements still lingers with us. Her determination and clarity of purpose
            still inspires us. Zindabad, Ilina.

                Vidya Bal, or Vidya tai to many, especially in Maharashtra, was a feminist
                icon, popular magazine editor and founder of several political initiatives
                in her long and eventful life. But for us in Saheli, she was simply and
                amazingly, just Vidya. Loved by all of us not just because her daughter
                Vineeta has been a long time Saheli, but because Vidya’s warm and loving
                persona was a perfect complement to her sharp political convictions. As
                a tiny group that struggles to publish a bi-annual newsletter, we were
                totally floored when she shared how she and her group publish the
                monthly magazine, Miloon Saryajani, consistently since 9 August 1989
                (coincidentally on Saheli’s eight anniversary!). We felt the strength of
                her spirit when she spoke out fearlessly against the targeted killing of
                the eminent rationalist, Narendra Dabholkar, only to find herself facing
                death threats at almost the age of 80!

        Vidya was inspiring in many ways
                too. She reconfigured the famed feminist slogan of ‘personal is political’
                by proving that ‘political can go far beyond the personal’. 
        <br>
        Many instances
                come to mind. When Vidya realised she didn’t know enough about
                emerging LGBTQI+ issues, she chose to engage with those who could
                help her understand and teach her, before she stepped out in support and
                even led the Pune Pride. Vidya also led a legal battle for women’s right
                to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the Shani Shingnapur temple, even
                though she was herself an avowed atheist. That’s the kind of feminism
                not everyone can believe in, much less, live. But Vidya did, and we’ll
                always be inspired by that. <br> <br>
                 <span>
                You are missed far beyond the state of Maharashtra, Vidya. With much love, from all of us in Saheli, New Delhi.

            This remembrance note must start with an apology to Kalpana Mehta. One
            day, when we were doing our usual adda-baazi she said, ‘Don’t try to write
            me off with a few pages of an obituary, I want a whole issue of the Saheli
            Newsletter on me.’ And Vani had replied flippantly, ‘Who’s going to put in so
            much effort, Kalpana? You’d better write it yourself, and translate it into Hindi
            as well, before you go.’ We all laughed out, our loud cackles filling the room,
            and hers crinkling up her eyes and shaking her whole body with glee. So,
            sorry Kalpana this issue isn’t about you but it is about the political concerns,
            struggles, hopes, rage and desperations we shared as friends, saathis and
            Sahelis... so in that sense, we think you’ll approve. On a more serious note
            though, this is a very difficult piece to write. As Savita said, ‘It’s impossible to
            put 40 years of friendship into words.’ But the real challenge is even bigger
            than that: Kalpana wasn’t just a friend, a saathi, a founder member of Saheli,
            she was a force of nature – loud, warm, wonderful, vibrant, fearless, loving,
            emotional, unpredictable, systematic, funny, determined, experienced, anadi
            (naïve)... and much more.

                As a young woman, Kalpana was doing her MBA in the U.S. after completing
                her B. Tech in Aeronautical Engineering from IIT-Kanpur when the Emergency
                was declared. When she returned to India in 1976, the country was still reeling
                under its impact. After a few years with trade unions, Kalpana joined other
                women from the Left and socialist movements as they started to organize
                themselves on issues confronting women – in what has since come to be known
                as the autonomous women’s movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
                An important part of this history is the founding of Saheli Women’s Resource
                Centre in Delhi on 9 August 1981, by ‘8 women – Amiya Rao, Bharati Roy
                Chaudhry, Buchy aka Lakshmi, Gouri Chowdhry, Kalpana Mehta, Rukmini Rao,
                Vichitra, Vidya Rao – with 80 rupees, two jhadoos, one notebook, a flyswatter
                and the strength of their convictions’, as the legend goes.

            Ashima recalls, ‘It was early 1981 when I faced the first big challenge of my
            life. My marriage had crumbled, I had no job, and all that I could call my own
            including my clothes, personal effects and money in a joint bank account were
            out of reach. I also didn’t have anyone to turn to for advice and comfort except
            my parents. That is when my father took me to meet his youngest brother and
            sister-in-law, Gouri Chowdhury. That was on 4 August 1981, just a few days
            before Saheli was formally inaugurated. It was the day I met a bunch of young
            women who listened keenly to this very unhappy, confused and stressed out
            female. Their empathy and patience had a huge effect on me: this was the
            comfort zone which I had been searching for. Among the few who stood out
            for me was Kalpana. Somehow I was convinced that I had found my pillars
            of strength. During the period that followed – of a new job, receiving divorce summons in the office, finances in
            doldrums, making daily trips to Saheli office in Nizamuddin after work, the going got tougher. There were many
            moments when I would burst into tears. One day Kalpana took me outside the Saheli office and hugged me till I
            stopped crying. Since then she was always there when I needed advice and guidance, and her home was where
            I went to relax and spend some happy times. Of course, I got a lot of strength from other Saheli members too –
            together they helped me rebuild my tattered life.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Savita remembers that in 1981 when she came to Saheli seeking help on her personal crisis, the office would
            open only in the evenings. Like Ashima, Savita too became part of Saheli, and was in fact, the group’s first full
            timer dealing with other women’s problems: going to the police station with them, dealing with dowry death
            cases, following up on FIRs and medical reports. ‘Kalpana had the ability to spot talent and channelize it. She
            encouraged me to do all this, and even to write about these experiences for the first Saheli newsletter,’ reminisces
            Savita, who still has to be cajoled into writing so many years later (clearly, we don’t all have Kalpana’s charm!).
        </p>
        <p>
            It was soon after the 1984 riots that Ramani came to Saheli. ‘I met Kalpana, Elizabeth Vatsyayan and Nalini Bhanot
            – they were the regulars at Saheli. Ashima Roy Chowdhry, Ranjana Padhi, Savita Sharma, Rukmini Rao, Sadhna
            Arya, Sujata Madhok, Laxmi Murthy, Nilanjana Mukherjee and Malati Rao would also come on some days. It was
            a very interactive and cohesive group. Saheli did case-work those days, so they taught me how to talk to women
            in distress and write daily case-diaries. We also had weekly study classes about feminist issues and politics. I left
            Saheli after a few years when I started teaching full time. When I returned after nearly a decade, the affection
            and welcome I got from Kalpana and everyone else made me feel so much at home. This openness of all Sahelis
            is what makes the group so special.’
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘I always saw Kalpana as very confident, courageous, intelligent, and sharp in her Left and feminist politics,”says
            Sadhna. “Once she was convinced of something, she would lose no time in going ahead with it even if it invited
            criticism or made some people unhappy. In the first Saheli publication titled, The First Four Years, Kalpana writes,
            ’I come because I belong. It is not always love and warmth, it is fights and bickering as well. It is not always the
            work I think I should be doing – but then I belong HERE, with all other Sahelis, so I come... One breathes Saheli
            and sometimes it is breath of fresh air and at others... small rewards keep you growing and keep your faith in
            “try and try again”. There are times of stress and distrust, times of peak activity and discovering togetherness...
            Something we share is the courage to swim together against the tide – whether it is on the Egalitarian Civil Code
            or opposing population control, the penny pinching in our work and the chaos in which we function.’ Decades
            later Kalpana’s words ring true for most of us – through all the emotional bursts, highs and lows of being a Saheli.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘She was genuinely caring towards anyone who was troubled, but on the flip side, she could be very tough and
            could hurt people,’ remembers Ashima. ‘I will never forget that during a weekly meeting, everyone was being
            asked to commit more time to Saheli work, and I said I couldn’t. Kalpana said I should work in Saheli during my
            next annual leave and not go off traversing to some foreign land. After much arguments and mediation I agreed,
            but I was angry. But over time, I understood that it was her dedication to Saheli and the women’s movement that
            drove her to push me that way.’
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadhna notes,’Kalpana understood that as a small organisation, we need to strategise to take our perspective/s
            forward, connect with struggles of working class women, and engage with mass based organisations like AIDWA,
            NFIW, etc., be part of struggles against displacement and its impact on women be they because of “conflict” or
            “development”. In fact, at the event marking 25 years of Saheli, she spoke passionately about the need for metro
            based women’s groups to connect more deeply with groups and women in smaller towns. Equally, she believed
            that institutions of the state should be held accountable. ‘Until we organise women on a wider basis, the most
            we can do is to act as a vigilant body, to see that these institutions/forces are used to protect rather than exploit
            the oppressed. The need is to extend ourselves – increase our collective strength.’ So it was no surprise that she
            was an integral part of planning and implementing a sit-in inside the office of the Drugs Controller of India (DCI)
            against hazardous long acting contraceptives, leading a protest into the NCW office to demand the report on jail
            conditions of Soni Sori and others, compelling the NCW team to visit a displacement site in Madhya Pradesh, or
            the Cover-Up Campaign, in which we dumped countless bedsheets with political messages at the CBI headquarters
            for their “next cover-up” after they wilfully botched up the Shopian double rape and murder investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‘‘Her zest for life took the form of delightful subversions as political strategy,’
            remembers Vani. ‘When I first started coming to Saheli, the group was in the
            throws of the campaign against EP drugs (High dose combination hormonal
            pills and injections that were wrongly and harmfully used to diagnose
            pregnancy). The government’s claim was that since it was supposedly
            available only on prescription, its (mis)use was controlled. To call out their
            lie, one strategy was for us to collect fake prescriptions and buy the drug
            over the counter with the name of the DCI as the prescribing doctor! To
            me, a neophyte in feminist politics, this seemed like too daring a move. But
            the Sahelis would just crack up with delight every time one of us came in
            with more ‘evidence’ that strengthened our case. And then of course was

            the historic ‘let’s-leap-over-the-walls-and-bust-a-public-relations-press-
            conference-on-Depo-Provera moment’. These may of course, have been

            the very moments when I fell in love with this group of badmaash aurtein
            called Saheli.’

            ‘After being in Delhi for 3-4 years one day in 1994, I went to Saheli to pick up
            a parcel that had been left for me,’ remembers Vineeta. ‘A group of women
            happily chatted with me and extended an open invitation to come to Saheli
            whenever I felt like. I have no recollection of who I met during that first
            visit, but I soon started dropping in, and before I realised it, I was roped
            into discussions, participating in meetings, and became a Saheli. Eventually
            I came to know Kalpana, Elizabeth, Laxmi, Ranjana, Sadhna, Vani better.
            But it was Kalpana who took me under her wing, as was her wont. She was
            warm, hospitable and often invited me to stay back at her place after Saheli
            meetings. Late night discussions, arguments about nuclear weapons and
            nuclear energy, contraceptive devices, vaccines, including anti-hCG vaccine
            as a contraceptive followed – while we agreed on the goal we were working
            towards, we often had strong disagreements about how we should get there.
            I was quite naive on the issue of population control, but Kalpana helped me
            get a grasp of it. Despite my inadequacies she asked me to help revise Saheli’s
            primer on women’s health and contraceptives [fondly described as the ‘Red
            Book’!]. Saheli’s work in women’s reproductive health helped me develop a
            feminist perspective on contraception and women’s health, and opened my
            eyes to the lack of social and economic understanding of health issues as
            they are taught in medical college.’
        </p>
            Besides Saheli, Kalpana was involved in the conceptualisation and setting
            up of several other feminist initiatives. ‘Paridhi’asought to research and
            manufacture diaphragms as part of a larger feminist search for effective
            barrier methods of contraception that would be healthy, safe and in the
            control of women themselves. She set up ‘Manasi’with a group of health
            activists and doctors to provide health care from traditional healing systems
            as well as allopathy. She was also a trained Reiki master who used the practice
            to heal others, as well as on herself, once she contracted the immensely
            debilitating ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, one type ofmotor neuron
            disease) which eventually took her away.
        <br><br>
            ‘One thing that perplexed me about Kalpana was her increasing dependence
            on and use of alternative forms of medicine such as Reiki. How could
            somebody, who waded through piles and piles of references and collected
            scientific information to counter the arguments made by those who forced
            hazardous contraceptives on women, start believing in forms of medicine where evidence for their use is still lacking?’ says Vineeta. ‘In the early 2000s when
            I joined Saheli, Kalpana was a name you read in the ‘First 4 Years’ booklet. As I
            stayed longer, it seemed that Kalpana was more a historical figure and less a real
            one, quoted here in a souvenir, there in a newsletter. As my involvement with Saheli
            deepened, I was sure that Kalpana was actually a concept, a feminist principle.
            When you meet such a figure in person you do what many younger feminists have
            done and will continue to do – challenge them, their methods... it’s inevitable. 20
            years later, I wish this had not been the case,’ muses Deepti. But differences weren’t
            what made or broke relationships with Kalpana. She had the ability to rise above
            them and reach out if she sensed unhappiness in someone; she could get up from
            an acrimonious Saheli meeting, and invite you over to share a drink, have a laugh,
            and continue the argument, of course! As Savita says, the ‘relationship with her was
            always both, political and familial.’
        <br><br>
            In the first decade of the 2000s, a small but determined group including Kalpana was
            instrumental in setting up Women Against Sexual Violence and State Repression
            (WSS) – a national level feminist response to the increasing use of sexual violence
            as a means of state repression – an attempt to address the failure of the mainstream
            women’s movement to respond adequately to the issue. The national canvas of the
            network, the range of activists and movements it drew together, brought Kalpana’s
            organisational and inter-personal skills to the fore once again, and gave her renewed
            strength and energy.
        <br><br>
            ‘Kalpana was always methodical and determined, but I am especially inspired by how
            she stayed politically engaged till the very end’ remembers Satnam. An apt tribute
            to a woman who beat the odds of her health condition to stay totally updated on
            issues till her last moments: raging against the CAA-NRC-NPR project; challenging
            the detention camps and saying, ‘I want to be a doubtful citizen and have them look
            after me in my current situation’; and signing a petition for the release of anti-CAA
            activists wrongly charged for sedition, just a day before she passed on.
        <br><br>
            In closing, a lovely memory: After the Saheli office was burnt down by a fire in 2009,
            we decided to gather in the office to get our energies back. In the crowd room, we
            all, Sahelis and friends of Saheli, sat together laughing, crying, talking over each
            other. And there she was, Kalpana sitting in the middle of everyone, singing – Mein
            Zindagi ka saath nibhata chala gaya, har fikr ko dhooyen mein udaata chala gaya...
        <br><br>
            Zindabad Kalpana. It’s hard to think of you in the past tense, but your work and its
            legacy lives on. They really don’t make them like you any more.

            <p style="flex: 1 1 300px; min-width: 240px; margin: 0;">
                As the concerns around Covid-19 began to surface in mid-March, and the lockdown
                began to be implemented, I found myself confused and unable to absorb the new
                moment we were all suddenly confronted with. The incomprehension itself was
                compounded by the series of events that had preceded it: first the NRC and the
                huge crisis in the north-eastern states followed quickly by the CAA assault upon us.
                The response to the CAA had led directly to the crackdown on protesting students
                at Jamia and Aligarh, and then the protests at Shaheen Bagh drew large numbers
                of Muslim women into an extraordinary protest that the government could not
                directly crackdown upon. Shaheen Baghs multiplied across Delhi and other cities all over India. It was a heady
                moment, especially for feminists to see these protests sweep the country, which the government was unable to stop.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
            Then the government came up with the manufactured and targeted violence against Muslims in north-east Delhi
            in February 2020. Before we could all absorb that, came the pandemic. Given the events that preceded it, including
            the daily bulletins about the collapse of the economy, the natural reaction was that the Covid was extremely handy
            in diverting all the unrest into the crisis generated by the disease. It was therefore difficult to look at the panic that
            accompanied it in purely disease and remedy terms, which is what was expected of us.
        <br><br>
            Somehow, when the panic and the arrangements to deal with the disease took hold of the public imagination, I began
            to think of history and the past. That took me to the Buddha, where, according to the story line, prince Siddhartha
            first meets disease, old age, and death, and is so shocked by the phenomena that he needs to leave home and palace
            in search of an answer to human misery. He found his answer in ways that may or may not make sense to us today,
            but for me the pandemic is a “Buddha moment” in history. Suddenly, we are reminded that disease and death are
            imminent, that no one can escape it (because the Corona will hit everyone/anyone, whether you live in a palace or
            a shack), and that money cannot buy you an escape from it because a cure does not exist as yet.) Suddenly, then, the
            ephemeral neo-liberalised world where everyone’s ambition is to go higher and higher to achieve individual success
            has burst like the bubble it always was. In the face of the pandemic, jobs shrank or disappeared. The building boom
            came to a standstill as EMIs were hard to pay, markets were affected and the economy was admittedly in a crisis,
            far beyond the slowdown which was already upon us for at least a year before the lockdown hit us.
        <br><br>
            Pretty soon Corona was not just a reminder of disease, mortality and of the imminence of death, but about how we
            were handling the virus: of how we were responding to the enormous misery that had suddenly been unleashed
            upon us; and of how such large swathes of our people went from work and minimal food to hunger and degradation
            in a few days. Soon, when panic set in, which most of us did not understand, we were taken over by the images
            of labourers fleeing desperately from the cities to which they had earlier flocked, to escape the depredations of
            the disease, and the hunger and the humiliation it brought with it. <a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight:400;" href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/walked-on-tracks-to-avoid-police-check-posts-were-in-too-deep-sleep-to-hear-goods-train-coming-says-aurangabad-tragedy-survivor-8350121.html" target="_blank">Tansen Gond and his fellow labourers were
            walking home along the train tracks, as the surest way of reaching home, when they were overtaken by
            exhaustion and fell asleep on the tracks.</a> They were then run over by a cruel State that ran its trains to carry
            goods, rather than people like them, simply because they were mere labour—to work when it was convenient and
            necessary, and dump when times were bad. It was hard to absorb. It was a moment when history forced itself as
            an experience to go back to and seek answers from. So, here then are a few thoughts, put together from a stray
            recall of history.
        <br><br>
            <span style="font-weight:700;">To begin with, how do we, the post-liberalisation, post-Marxist world, see labour or understand it?</span> As online discussions on webinars started, the difference between policy-makers and scholars of labour became strikingly
            apparent: the former were talking about what the government could do realistically and what would not happen
            (because the government was not going to do it in the state we live in; the neo liberal withdrawal of the State was
            thorough and comprehensive since the 1990’s). Jan Breman, whose works on labour in Gujarat over a 30-year-period
            should be read by all, made a sharp comment on how labour was viewed by state, society and policy-makers alike:
            as a commodity, and not as citizens. I don’t think the policy-makers even understood what Breman was bringing up.
            His intervention reminded me of what I had taught my students in the history class on slavery in Greece and Rome.
            The Romans had a classification of what went into production.
            <span style="font-weight:700;">
                To begin with, <span style="font-style:italic;">instrumentum mutum</span>, the tools
                that were mute or could not speak, which were used in agriculture, such as the plough, the spade, and the
                sickle. Then there was the <span style="font-style:italic;">instrumentum semi vocale </span>, ‘tools’ that could ‘speak’ in part, such as bullocks and
                the other animals used in agriculture, which had a voice of sorts and might even protest. Finally, on the top
                of the scale, was the <span style="font-style:italic;">instrumentum vocale</span>, the speaking tool, denoting the slave who too was deemed to be a
                <span style="font-style:italic;">mere instrument of production</span>.</span>
                I am not sure we are still teaching such things anymore, but we do treat labour as
                dumb instruments of production. Thus, the enormous stocks of food in the godowns – produced collectively through
                cheap labour – is denied to the starving labourers by the State. They were thus compelled to walk home, in spite
                of the lockdown, to try and reclaim some of their dignity, braving the lathi blows showered on them by the police.
            </span>
        <br><br>
                Cut to today. What the fleeing labourers have shown us is that they not only know that they are mere instruments
                of production, but that they are caught in an unusual combination of circumstances that have hit them. They have
                been hit by an induced, man-made, famine of sorts but also a deadly disease, a pestilence that has no borders, that
                nothing can stop, and that they have no homes where they can lock themselves. Their panic is entirely rational; their
                desire to return home, often with their wives and children, and even parents who were with them in the cities, is
                not only about being with their extended families and communities; it is about soil and water and air and a place
                where you were born, and had something of a right to be in.

        <br>
                <span style="font-weight:700;">In history, famines and epidemics are usually distinct entities, not conflated into one. Because hunger is
                a running theme in the present crisis, I am unable to look at disease as distinct from hunger, deprivation
                and possible death.</span> David Arnold’s account of the Madras presidency famine in 1875-78, read now post-Covid,
                has many issues that resonate with today. People desperately looking for food, being fed in traditional charitable
                institutions, but not by the State; by erstwhile rulers who were performing their ‘raj dharma’, by choultries and
                inns, and by wealthier members of the community. But it wasn’t enough. As hunger went deeper and deeper into
                their vitals, when they finished eating the dead animals which had themselves starved to death (the Brahmins
                could not do that though), they began to move into the hills of the Niligiris in a panic distress mode – a kind of
                search for an El Dorado. Or they went to the towns, for the countryside had nothing for them to eat. It was at that
                time that <a style="text-decoration:none; font-weight:400;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandita_Ramabai" target="_blank">Pandita Ramabai</a> lost her parents. Ramabai’s family (comprising her parents, a sister, and a brother)
                were peripatetic wanderers who travelled on foot from village to village, telling harikatha stories and surviving
                on what the villagers fed them. But the famine took its toll. There was no food to spare. The family was trapped
                by culture and caste, so it could not labour. Ramabai’s father was the first to go. He decided he would simply
                turn the moment into the end that he desired: he was old anyway, so he took <span style="font-style:italic;">samadhi</span> and ended his life as many
                <span style="font-style:italic;">sanyasis</span> did. Ramabai’s sister went next in the famine. Her mother, who was much younger than her father, began
                to waste away. Desperate to save her mother after days of enforced fasting, Ramabai decided to go and beg for
                some food. Some kind person gave her a piece of bajra roti, which she brought back and tried to feed her mother
                with. However, her mother could not absorb any food in her starved condition, and died – another victim of the
                great famine. It was such a bad time that there weren’t even four pall bearers to carry the bier, and so Ramabai
                became one of the pall bearers. However, as she was too short to use her shoulder, her end of the bier had to be
                supported by her head. In Ramabai’s own words:<br><br>
                <span style="font-style:italic;">I cannot describe all the sufferings of that terrible time. My father, mother and sister all died of starvation within a few
                months of each other... we continued to walk ceaselessly but the gods did not appear to us. Slowly we began to lose faith...<sup style="font-size:10px;">1</sup></span>

                Ramabai never forgot this famine and the terrible distress that came
                in its wake. When the next great famine came around in central India
                in 1897, she went there from Poona on a rescue mission and brought
                back hundreds of children, especially girls who would be the first to
                be abandoned by their parents or be taken advantage of by men who
                would be on the lookout for girls to use in the brothels later.
                <br> 
                The hundreds of famine survivors she brought back went into the
                home she ran for widows in Poona. It was surrounded by wealthier
                householders who objected to the rabble she had brought into the home
                she ran. The municipality sent her a notice to take the rabble away. It
                mattered little that Ramabai had rescued them from death. But what do the elites care for the starving? The
                same is true of governments for whom ‘rules’ are more important than human beings. Resourceful as ever,
                Ramabai moved the entire institution to a piece of land she had acquired some 60 miles from Poona. The picture
                on the right is of the hospital in Mukti Sadan, and the extraordinary photograph on the previous page is of meal
                time at the Mukti Sadan, marked by a long line of people with plates in hand, a visual reminder of that moment in
                our history. Ramabai paid her debt to her parents in the best way she could.

        <br><br>
            The colonial government took harsh measures to forcibly lockdown suspected cases of the disease, and in one such
            swoop officials carried away a girl from the sadan to the segregation camp. The girl was abducted from there by one
            of the municipal officials. A furious Ramabai wrote a letter to the newspapers, which was taken up by a member of
            parliament in Britain. The Bombay government was furious with her, and accused her of lying; she in turn hit back
            and accused the governor of lying! Ramabai’s mentors were horrified and accused her of sedition, but she stood
            her ground, refusing to back down while many of the Brahmin men who had also objected to the search and control
            measures and accused the government of arbitrary actions during the epidemic, did. The government had forcibly
            taken away people into segregation camps, invaded homes and were perceived as using state power in unacceptable
            ways. In the end, everyone took back their accusations; only Ramabai refused to take back her allegations, earning
            her some respect from her old adversary Tilak, who had earlier damned her for converting to Christianity, which
            he had regarded as a betrayal of her “people”; the nation was already a Hindu nation in his understanding.
        <br><br>
            <span style="font-weight:700;">Arbitrary actions by the state, whether colonial or post-colonial, almost always seem to let down the poor
            and the marginal women and men of our societies.</span> Far from doing their duty to be <span style="font-style:italic">‘mai baap,’</span> they leave them
            to fend for themselves. Instead of food, the desperate people are inflicted with violence by the police; and when
            they find their own way to escape hunger and degradation they face more violence. Far from living in a society
            that acknowledges the rights of people who labour as citizens – and not as commodities – those who labour
            have been abandoned to the vagaries of the neo-liberal economy, which undergirds the state and all its actions.
            It is a supremely uncaring State.
        <br><br>
            It is time to recall Buddha’s emphasis on compassion: <span style="font-weight:700;">the state could do with some humanity, some ethics,
            and some <span style="font-style:italic">karuna.</span></span> But do we care? Like Ramabai, we need to stand up and demand from our government that
            it too stands up to discharge its duty to its people, and not remain indifferent to the greatest humanitarian
            crisis of our times.

            As we are faced with tragic images of migrant workers fleeing
            the Coronavirus lockdown on foot, I’m reminded of artist
            Chittoprosad’s haunting artworks of the Bengal famine
            in 1943. That was a human tragedy caused by the racist
            callousness of Winston Churchill and the British colonial
            government. History seems to be repeating itself - except that
            the people behind the tragedy unfolding before us today are
            Narendra Modi and his elected Indian government.

            <br>
            <span style="font-weight:600;">Statement by Saheli on the State’s inhuman treatment of the poor. 31 March 2020</span>
            <br>
            <span style="text-align:center; font-weight:600;">Apologies about the distress caused by the lockdown mean nothing without acknowledging (and
            correcting) the transgressions of the state against the people who are worst hit by this crisis.</span>
            <br><br>
            Our heads must hang in collective shame at pictures of poor, migrant and marginalised people - women and
            men, young and old, children and people with disabilities, people from underprivileged communities - being
            inhumanly treated by state administrations, and the security forces.
            <br><br>
            The anti-poor, anti-Dalit, anti-Muslim, regional and ethnic biases propagated by the powers that be are in
            blatant display during this, the greatest humanitarian crisis that we, and most other countries have ever faced.
            Since the last few days, extremely poor daily wagers have been leaving many major cities to try and reach their
            villages and home towns to escape the joblessness (and pennilessness) they are facing under the lockdown, the
            lack of any economic and social security, and total uncertainty about returning to work. Without money and
            resources, they have taken to the roads, with nothing to eat and no drinking water, leave aside water and soap
            to wash their hands! Yet they have been further traumatised by security forces beating them, making them sit
            with heads in between their legs as ‘punishment’ for breaking curfew, and most horrifying of all, being sprayed
            with pesticide chemicals to ‘disinfect’ them – with no concern for their health, safety or dignity! Was this done
            to those who were brought back by planes from other countries, who could actually have been the first carriers
            of deadly corona virus?
            <br><br>
            The PM, CMs and many other government officials are issuing statements to create awareness about the virus,
            but unfortunately, their repeated messages on social media talk about ‘giving a free hand to law enforcement’.
            On the ground this has meant a ‘free hand’ for security personnel to stop the poor from stepping out to buy
            vegetables, beating citizens in minority dominated areas at ration shops, ostracising and harassing those
            already at the margins of our society – Dalit, Muslim, Trans persons, sex workers, persons with disabilities
            etc who have, for the last several years, led amazing struggles for their rights as full citizens.
            <br><br>
            <span>Today, we reaffirm and invoke these very constitutional rights and assert that every person in India be treated
            with equality and dignity. <span style="font-weight:700">We urge the authorities to put an immeditae stop to the ruthless and inhuman
            display of power by the State agencies, and issue immediate orders to this effect.</span></span>
            <br>
            <span>The government at both the Centre and at state levels, needs to prove that they are the government of all,
            not just the privileged few.<span style="font-weight:700;"> After all, every society is judged by how it treats it’s poorest, weakest and
            most vulnerable.</span></span>

            The first year after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came back to power in May 2019 has been a year to reckon
                with. The country saw deep polarization around the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC)
                in Assam, the sudden abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and nationwide peaceful protests against
                Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Then Delhi witnessed targeted communal violence in February 2020. All of
                these protests against the high handedness of the Central Government as well as all economic, social and cultural
                activities came to a sudden halt in the third week of March, with the announcement of a nation-wide complete
                lockdown on the backdrop of SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus 2) making inroads
                in India; the first case being reported in end January, and people falling ill with Covid-19 (Corona Virus Disease
                2019). Democracy and the constitutional rights were put on hold by invoking the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897.

        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight:400;">Virus SARS-CoV2 and the illness Covid-19</span>
        <br><br>
        The presence of a rapidly spreading virus has created a panic situation in India and globally. The virus is new, the
        present-day humans have not encountered it before, unlike the flu virus or polio virus. The high level of media
        publicity given to the illness and very high frequency of irrational, unscientific information-sharing regarding the
        ability of the virus to spread and kill; and description of misplaced power of the folk-remedies has created fear
        psychosis in the country, and indeed the whole world. In his first appeal to the nation, the Prime Minister called
        it an enemy which needs conquering, without realizing that viral enemies are nearly impossible to conquer or
        to get rid of once they establish themselves in the populace.
        <br><br>
        What basic information do we need? That SARS-CoV2 virus is similar to other viruses we have encountered
        before. It will infect large sections of the population that it can reach. The virus spreads very efficiently by
        sneezing, coughing, spitting, or even with public speaking when air is forcefully expelled from our nose or
        mouth. Most healthy young people recover after the infection without experiencing illness. Of about say 1000
        people infected, 850-900 will not need even a doctor’s help, will not know they got infected, but will recover
        on their own; or will have a mild fever, cough or cold. Of the remaining 100-150 who will seek doctor’s advice,
        about 20-30 will need proper hospitalization with possible oxygen and ventilator support. Not everybody who
        needs ventilator support dies, in fact only a few, maybe five, may die. Amongst those who are more vulnerable to
        COVID-19 are the elderly, those with diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, lung problems, and other
        co-morbidities. Thus, nearly 990 or more people out of each 1000 will recover without serious consequences
        and develop immunity to this virus; for how long is something that is yet to be established. What we need
        today is this understanding of the severity or otherwise of Covid-19 disease at the population level, and a
        stop to the paranoia that is so deeply affecting individual lives. Admittedly, there are no effective drugs for
        Covid-19 treatment today, but there are very few drugs to treat viral infections any way, and Covid-19 is not
        an exception. In India today more people die of tuberculosis every day than the number of people dying with
        Covid-19. In urban India people do take a note of risks associated with road travel and commute every day,
        by accepting the risk. Take personal precautions, accept the risk and move on carefully with life. That is the
        attitude we need to develop for Covid-19.
        <br><br>
        What we do need to follow is ways of maintaining
        physical distancing and personal hygiene to the best
        of our ability, in the given circumstances. Socially
        ostracizing patients, families, medical and paramedical
        staff, etc. are signs of paranoia rather than sensitive,
        rational thinking. We do need to wear rationality on
        our sleeve, not blind faith. Various experts - doctors,
        epidemiologists, immunologists are trying their best
        to give this message of rationality, evidence-based
        decision making to help in decreasing fear psychosis.
        Unfortunately these leaders in science do not have
        large public support and following which the political,
        spiritual, religious leaders can garner. Hence, whenever
        leaders with mass appeal address their followers
        they should be spreading scientific information about
        Covid-19 and not pseudoscientific information or
        magic remedies which have no basis.

            <p style="flex: 1 1 300px; min-width: 240px; margin: 0;">
            Fear of the unknown precipitated the invocation of the Act
            in March 2020. In order to tackle the plague epidemic, the
            British rulers had promulgated the Act, which gave the
            government powers to enter houses, conduct searches,

            put people in quarantine, impose restrictions on travel,
            etc. Anybody found disobeying orders could be put in
            jail. These provisions of the Act, along with large-scale
            fear psychosis, has resulted in people of India being
            deprived of their constitutional rights. Many examples
            can be cited. In the initial days of the epidemic Tablighi
            Jamaat congregation was targeted. Some individuals who
            attended the congregation were put into jail and there
            was no easy way to appeal against their imprisonment.
            At one point migrant workers desperately trying to go
            home were put into jail because at that time travel by any
            means across regions was completely banned. While the
            Prime Minister praised doctors and paramedical staff as
            “Corona Warriors” some doctors publicly talking about
            not having protective gear, not receiving pay for a few
            months despite working in difficult situation during
            the pandemic, were served notice for indiscipline or
            removed from the job! The list is unending. Anything that
            is deemed as a disagreement with the government orders
            or a protest, is considered punishable and the concerned
            individuals can face the consequences - arrest, fine, jail
            time, etc. We, as a society, have lost our democratic right
            to dissent. Emergency-like situation was brewing up
            preceding the epidemic but the virus was the final nail. It
            also provided a handy excuse to the present government
            to blame everything that was going wrong on every front,
            including on the economic front, on the virus!
            </p>

        <br><br>
        A nationwide lockdown for 21 days announced at 8 p.m.
        on 25 March 2020 with a four-hour notice by PM Modi
        resulted in complete paralysis of work and life. Due
        to invocation of the Act, there was nationwide curfew
        imposed making any kind of travel - by road, railway,
        air - a punishable offence. Was the lockdown necessary?
        <br><br>
        If one looks at the medical preparedness of the country
        the lockdown was essential. For decades, successive
        governments have steadily neglected investment in public
        health system and in building public hospitals. The period
        of lockdown was supposed to help build infrastructure
        and acquire essential equipment to tackle the pandemic.
        However, there was no need for nationwide lockdown at
        that time or even until date. Location-specific, focussed
        lockdowns would have had much better outcome.
        Besides, the lockdown period proved to be completely
        inadequate for preparation of medical infrastructure,
        manpower training and recruitment etc.
        <br><br>
        The figure below shows that in India even after
        prolonging the period of lockdown the number of cases
        continued to go up. In contrast, in other developed
        countries such as Spain, Italy, Germany and UK shown
        in the figure, lockdown brought down the number of
        daily cases. Multiple reasons, including infrastructure
        and operational failures as mentioned below were/are
        responsible for steadily increasing cases.
        <br><br>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; column-gap:14px; align-items: center;">
            <p style="flex: 1 1 300px; min-width: 240px; margin: 0;">
            People in the medical profession and those engaging
            with public health issues in the country have for long
            been raising their concerns around the crumbling
            health infrastructure in the country. India did not have
            enough labs equipped to diagnose infected individuals,
            not enough personal protective gears for medical and
            paramedical personnel, not enough trained people
            who could impart correct information to police force,
            ambulance staff, security staff as well as public at large
            to take adequate care of themselves, not enough beds to
            take care of serious patients who will need hospitalisation
            and possibly ventilator support. The list is unending.
            </p>

        <br><br>
        The figure above shows how year after year the
        expenditure on health has remained stagnant to
        around 1% of the GDP. A demand from the health
        activists, public health professionals to increase it to
        a minimum of 3% has not found any acceptance in the
        corridors of power. Expenditure on public health is
        much higher in some other nations as shown in the
        figure and even our neighbouring country Sri Lanka
        spends more of its GDP on health!
        <br><br>
        As mentioned above the three week long Lockdown 1.0
        was supposed to give time to get health infrastructure
        in place - before people start moving out, and could
        catch or infect each other in large numbers. One can
        imagine rapid spread of infection in enclosed spaces,
        including public transport such as metros, buses or
        Mumbai’s suburban trains. We were instructed not to
        step out of the house, and maintain “social distancing”
        — a phrase politically extremely inappropriate, since in
        India caste related “social distancing” is still practised
        and all over the world where race/colour-based social
        distancing is still rampant!
        <br><br>
        In the present phase of “unlock” after minimum of
        8-10 weeks of lockdown in different parts of the
        country, we still see the cases of Covid-19 rising
        steadily, the health infrastructure close to breaking
        point, because of sheer numbers of serious patients
        needing support. This breakdown is despite efforts to
        ramp up infrastructure. However, you cannot make a
        dying horse run a race with a little bit of food thrown
        at him. Even though the ruling Aam Aadmi Party in
        Delhi has tried to improve health infrastructure over
        the past few years, the failure to cope with the current
        crisis is staring in everybody’s face. The situation in
        other metro cities and states like Maharashtra and
        Tamil Nadu is even more severe.
        <br><br>
        A serious consequences of this unpreparedness
        and poor health infrastructure is that non-Covid-19
        patients, pregnant women or women in need of
        abortion, patients who get their drugs from government
        health centres, including women seeking contraceptive
        pills, children who need to be vaccinated, the elderly
        with other health problems have all been deprived
        of their needs. This is going to add to the burden of
        disease and ill health enormously.
        <br><br>
        The other major burden on society that was imposed by
        invocation of the Act and sudden, prolonged lockdown
        was on the poor, homeless people or those who depended
        on their daily wages for survival. Their plight has been
        indescribable. While the government machinery provided
        measly support to those who were forced to head home
        because the city couldn’t support them, or relieve them
        of their hunger and fear, there was massive media
        coverage and indeed, international attention on the issue.
        Despite numerous efforts by citizens to help each other,
        we were confronted by terrible tales of hunger related
        deaths, women giving birth on the roads, children being
        malnourished and sleeping and tired men, being run over
        by a train. And people dying of exhaustion, heat, hunger
        and thirst in the special trains that were finally started.
        Unfortunately, the number of deaths due to lockdown,
        and not directly proven as due to the virus, will not be
        included in the pandemic associated deaths.
        <br><br>
        These measures are nowhere near enough because
        the magnitude of the impact of lockdown on economic
        activity has been grave - the economy has nose-dived
        to a 11 year low. The government’s projection of GDP
        growth for 2020-21 is 1.9%, an optimistic scenario if
        one is to look at projections by several international
        institutions and the downgrading of India’s sovereign
        ratings. It’s important to point out that the current
        situation is not entirely because of the lockdown. The
        economy was not in good health even before lockdown
        was announced — it was growing at 4.2% during
        financial year 2019-20, as compared to 6.1% in the
        previous year. Additionally, the Centre for Monitoring
        Indian Economy released its unemployment figures
        which stated that close to 120 million people were out
        of work/job in April 2020. Though new data indicates
        that some of the lost jobs have been recovered but
        without a substantial fiscal stimulus it will take a long
        time before we are back to the pre lockdown scenario.

            <br>
            The continued lockdown has also affected all industries adversely. And while the big industries are also
            affected those in small and medium categories are close to being wiped out permanently. The economic cost
            of the pandemic, worsened by prolonged lockdown is enormous and the situation will only worsen in the
            next few months, despite efforts at opening up places and partial restorationof transport. The government
            has played major games while announcing financial packages for supporting people and industries.
            <br><br>
            Nearly 8 weeks into the lockdown, Prime Minister Modi announced a special economic package “Self-reliant
            India Movement/ AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan” of INR 20 lakh Crore, a grand 10% of India’s GDP.

                <p style="flex: 1 1 300px; min-width: 240px; margin: 0;">
                Half of the announced package already included liquidity
                measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India and the fiscal
                package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
                As details of the economic package were outlined by the Finance
                Minister in five tranches, it became apparent that the actual
                fiscal relief (actual government expenditure) will be a mere
                1% of the GDP (another example of <span>‘naam bade aur darshan

        <span style="font-weight:400;">Leadership, decision making and transparency.</span>
        <br><br>
        The sudden lockdown and further extensions of it with
        the Act in place was a clear failure in the planning by
        the political leadership and its advisors. While the
        requirement to control the spread of the disease and
        balancing it with the need of economic slowdown was
        the need of the hour, the balancing act was prominent
        by its absence. A clear thought process and direction
        was lacking. It is true that Covid-19 is a new disease
        and hence its behaviour was an unknown factor. Thus
        decision making had to be based on information
        about similar epidemics, some predictions, use of
        modern technology and at the same time learning from
        other disasters which, in the past, had led to massive
        disruption of economic activity. Indian leaders did not
        manage it well. Some countries managed to tackle the
        spread of the epidemic successfully and most others
        did not. Even in India, Kerala consistently stood out
        as the best state which managed to control the spread
        of the epidemic and prevented major surge in the
        number of cases despite Keralites stranded outside
        India coming back in large numbers. The reasons for
        their success are many, but a responsive government,
        pre-emptive social security plans including free food,
        advance pension disbursements, rigorous testing,
        reasonable health infrastructure including manpower
        trained for contact tracing, contributed significantly.
        Kerala’s Health Minister, Ms. K.K. Shailaja and her team
        received laurels from many quarters, deservedly so. In
        contrast, the approval ratings for the Prime Minister
        himself over the crisis period surged, leaving one
        wondering how such ratings are managed! Was his
        appeal to the nation to bang on plates on one occasion,
        or asking them to light lamps the second time, and
        becoming self reliant or “atma nirbhar” the third time
        responsible for this?
        <br><br>
        The utter callousness of the government machinery
        and decision makers was apparent on many fronts. For
        example, whom to test for the virus, whom to isolate,
        whom to quarantine, whether to do contact tracing
        only for primary contacts or also secondary contacts,
        how to report Covid-19 related statistics to the media -
        these were some of the issues on which there was lack
        of clarity. Similarly, whether to allow internal migrants

        <br><br>
        We are in the phase of unlock, gradually opening the
        lockdown status with a steady increase in infected
        individuals. We are clearly hurtling towards herd
        immunity. The economy, already the worst ever for the
        last few decades before the pandemic, is in shambles
        now. Even the government coffers have hit rock
        bottom, though strangely enough the PM Cares (Prime
        Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency
        Situations), a newly registered society supposedly set
        up ‘for combating, and containment and relief efforts
        against the coronavirus outbreak and similar pandemic
        like situations in the future’ is accumulating vast sums
        of money. But there has been no declaration on what is
        being done with that money. Does it replace the Prime
        Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) that has been
        in place since 1948, no one knows. Just as no one knows
        how much longer this will continue.
        <br><br>
        It appears that the country has not reached the peak
        of infectivity yet, which means patient numbers will
        continue to go up. Many people have high hopes from
        the vaccine, which is unlikely to become available in the
        near future. If a safe and reasonably effective vaccine
        becomes available, it will only be in 2021. Whether it
        will be available to poor countries like India remains a
        question, and even within India, who will have access
        to it or be able to afford it are other crucial questions.
        <br><br>
        This might not be the last pandemic we encounter.
        As human population is expanding and taking over
        niches for wildlife, viruses from the wildlife are
        reaching humans at a higher frequency. Therefore,
        we need to think about decreasing encroachment and
        thinking about more eco-friendly ways to live. We also
        need to invest in disease surveillance systems more
        to anticipate and track such diseases. Not just for
        Covid-19 but for tuberculosis, malaria, filariasis, kala-
        azar, Japanese Encephalitis also we need surveillance
        systems. Their necessity needs to be acknowledged.
        Establishment of a workforce for health surveillance
        and vaccination beyond much exploited ASHA
        (Accredited Social Health Activists) workers is a need
        of the hour. The government needs to create this job
        opportunity. India’s health budget needs to go up (and
        stay up) to avoid future catastrophic outcomes as we
        are experiencing today.
        <br><br>
        Instead of addressing the situation with such a long-
        term perspective, the nation, driven by Prime Minister
        Modi, is persuaded to believe that every step taken by
        the government is a step promoting nationalistic pride.
        One reason for this pseudo nationalism is an argument
        that SARS-CoV2 is a China-made virus and the
        pandemic we see is an outbreak of bioterrorism. Based
        on scientific evidence, this appears to be a rumour,
        which has been perpetuating and strengthening
        pseudo nationalism. While invasion around the Line
        of Actual Control (LAC) by China is reprehensible,
        incidents of attacks on north easterners calling them
        “Chinese/Chinky” and hence responsible for the virus
        are further scars on our already torn fabric of society.
        Anyonewho seeks answers to critical questions, be
        they doctors, lawyers, social workers, or other citizens
        is being called anti-national. Such notions of pseudo
        nationalism perpetuated during this period need to be
        urgently dispelled.
        <br><br>
        We are in the process of evolving a “new normal” way
        of life. The lockdown had imposed severe restrictions
        on people’s movements and travel. Those Indians who
        have access to internet have evolved a new normal
        which includes working from home, holding work
        meetings online, meeting friends and relatives online
        without real human contact. Unfortunately, it has also
        extended to meeting your family member or a friend
        admitted to the hospital online and also attending
        memorial meetings online. Majority of the populace
        from “Bharat” does not have access to internet and
        smart phones. The internet access is an additional
        divisive force between different groups of people.
        The gap between the rich and the poor, those with
        internet access and those without, students who can
        join online teaching and those who cannot, is widening.
        SARS-CoV2 virus is not the only contributor to it but
        the poor economic situation of the country and poor
        management of resources is also responsible. This
        “new normal” is even more discriminatory and unjust
        for the underprivileged sections of the society. There
        is urgent need to fight the spread of the virus and the
        “new normal” way of life.

                The last two Saheli Newsletters (March-August 2018 and March 2019) have
                featured articles on why the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights)
                Bill (henceforth, the Trans Bill), 2016 has been deeply problematic. Yet in
                December 2018, it was passed in the Lok Sabha without giving widespread
                critiques by trans*, intersex and gender-non conforming communities, or
                even the recommendations of the Standing Committee, to which it had been
                referred, or even the political opposition, any consideration. However, the Bill
                later lapsed because the ruling party did not have the numbers necessary to
                pass it in the Rajya Sabha. As soon as the BJP-led government came back to
                power after the general elections of May 2019, a slightly revised Trans Bill was
                reintroduced in the Lok Sabha on 19 July 2019, with just a few provisions done
                away with, such as the criminalization of begging, and the establishment of a
                District Screening Committee for issuing certification to transgender persons.
                However, the Trans Bill continued to fail both, the spirit of the National Legal
                Services Authority (NALSA) v Union of India judgment 2014, as well as
                core, long standing demands of communities in various ways.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Briefly, the Trans Bill failed the right of transgender persons to self-determine
        their gender identity without undergoing humiliating medical check ups or
        sex reassignment surgeries; neglected to make mandatory reservations for
        the trans* community in employment, education, healthcare etc., or attach
        penalties for discrimination of transpersons. Further, it requires that they
        must reside with their birth family, even though the birth families are often
        the first site of violence. The Trans Bill also laid down the stipulation that if
        transpersons wished to move out of families, they must approach the courts to
        access a shelter/rehabilitation home – denying them the constitutional right of
        freedom of movement and residence; and in the bargain de-legitimized their
        form and belong to social ‘family-like’ structures of their choice and making.
        As if all these were not enough reasons to <span style="font-weight:400;font-style:italic;">Kill the Bill</span> as the popular slogan
        went, it treated sexual violence against transpersons as a lesser crime than that
        on cis-gendered persons, prescribing a maximum of 3 years’ imprisonment
        for rape as opposed to 7 years for rape of women.
        <br><br>
        Yet this dreadful Trans Bill was passed again by Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019
        with some minor amendments, and was poised to be sent to the Rajya Sabha
        when we decided that we had to initiate something new.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight:400">New Feminist Conversations</span>
        <br><br>
        In recent times, feminists and feminist groups in the
        country have (finally) stood with transpersons in the
        fight for equal rights to citizenship, dignity, opportunity,
        access, education, health and justice. Yet, a deeper
        understanding of how gender non-conforming and
        trans* identities disrupt, complicate and yet, energize
        conversations around gender and feminism have been
        long overdue. So some women’s groups decided to
        get together and invite LBT, queer and trans feminist
        groups from across the country to a dialogue that we
        hoped would reshape the contours of our feminisms.
        Issuing the call were Forum Against Oppression of
        Women (FAOW), Mumbai; Saheli, New Delhi; National
        Federation of Indian Women; Nirantar, Delhi; Bebaak
        Collective; Maitree - Women’s Rights Network, Kolkata;
        Women’s and Transgender Communities Joint Action
        Committee, Hyderabad.
        <br><br>
        As the invite said, ‘After the reading down of Sec
        377, the privacy judgment, and NALSA judgment,
        there is a legal recognition of multiple sexual
        orientations and gender identities... it is time for
        more engaged conversations on the ways forward
        in securing protection from violence, including
        targeted domestic and sexual violence against
        transgender persons and persons persecuted
        because of sexual orientations and gender identity/
        expression. We need to start thinking brass tacks... If
        we do not have good answers and paths to offer, we
        are facing the scare of gender neutrality in all laws
        that address gendered violence. [Because] men’s
        groups have been demanding gender neutrality in
        all laws protecting women for quite some time now...
        There are trans* groups and gay groups who have
        also been seeing this as the only way to address the
        issue of sexual violence. We definitely need a broader
        conversation drawing from feminist and women’s
        groups’ experiences and learnings from working on
        gendered and sexual violence over the past many
        decades and trans* people’s lived realities and
        experience of dealing with this violence... Today’s
        scenario demands that we take our older discussions
        forward and come up with more specific demands.
        It demands that women’s groups from different
        marginalized locations, Dalit, Adivasi, Muslim, queer
        women, trans* people as also other identities that
        may not be already categorized, come together to
        re-chart our understandings of sexual violence and
        oppression; to talk about our lived realities in context
        of marriage, partnership, property, inheritance,
        adoption rights and existing laws... [which] might
        help us build a public discourse and grab attention
        on these matters which in turn may also help in
        building counter narratives to the communal,
        casteist, patriarchal and nationalist sentiments and
        culture we are confronting everywhere.’
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight:400">Sexual Violence, the Law & Us</span>
        <br><br>
        The response to the call was rather overwhelming and
        consequently, the meeting was very well attended.
        On 28-29 September 2019, over 60 old friends
        and new <span style="font-style:italic;">saathis</span> – cis, trans* and gender non-
        conforming, straight, queer, not-so-straight, not-so-
        queer individuals and members of about 35 feminist
        groups – arrived in Delhi from Maharashtra, Gujarat,
        Kolkata and Manipur, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil
        Nadu and Kerala. After Vani from Saheli got the meeting
        going, Rachana Mudraboyina from Help The Cause and
        Telangana Hijra Intersex Trans Samiti (THITS) talked
        about how various laws – amendments in rape laws
        post-Mathura and the December 2012 case, as well as
        the law against sexual harassment at workplace, etc
        all understand bodies in the binary, just as domestic
        violence is only discussed within a heteronormative
        concept of the home and family. The trans* figure/
        body only entered the discourse with NALSA in 2014
        but much of the conversation is still about gender
        as biology and not ‘identity’. Together we need to
        conceptualise ‘transfeminisms’ and move away from
        ‘trans-exclusive feminisms’. Because our feminisms
        have no place for TERFs (Trans-Exclusionary Radical
        Feminists) or FARTs! (Feminism Appropriating
        Reactionary Transphobes!) which of course got the
        discussion started with a laugh.
        <br><br>
        Chayanika Shah (FAOW and LABIA – A Queer Feminist
        LBT Collective) then got the discussion on <b>sexual
        assault laws</b> started by asking Bittu from THITS to
        share the experiences of violence on transpersons, key
        challenges and broad expectations of law. Bittu said on
        an everyday basis, sexual violence on transwomen is
        way higher than on cis women, but gender neutrality
        across the board is also very problematic. We know
        and argue that the survivor can be of any gender, but
        there are repercussions in making perpetrator gender
        neutral because the discourse is skewed. So policy must
        take into account gendered power relations as they
        play out in our lived experiences. We must seriously
        consider how to protect transmen against unfounded
        accusations in a transphobic world. Caste and class
        are other power vectors that complicate this analysis.
        Marital/partner rape should be rethought. We need to
        broaden the array of gender identities and spell things
        out within a legal framework.

                Vrinda Grover, feminist saathi and human rights
                advocate, started with a correction: Way before the
                NALSA judgment, PUCL-Karnataka had published a
                study on violence on kothi and hijra sex workers in
                Bangalore in 2003 titled, ‘Human Rights Violations
                against the Transgender Community’ (See report here).
                But she acknowledged that trans* and civil society
                activism have helped build visibility on issues faced by
                the community including violence. Clearly, we cannot
                agree to gender neutrality of the perpetrator because
                that assumes society is no longer patriarchal, which
                of course, is untrue! She warned against basing our
                arguments against gender neutrality on the grounds
                of “false cases”, reminding us that that is exactly what
                men’s rights groups are doing. They are undermining
                the basic principle that the law must protect the most
                affected, marginalised and vulnerable. She asserted
                that enumeration of types of gender specific violence
                need to be visibilised because so far, the imagination
                of the victim within law is of women. We also need
                to work to develop gender-specific evidentiary and
                procedural aspects as the women’s movements have
                done. If women are at all able to use laws today, it’s
                because of the procedural infrastructure we have
                put in place. But we also have to factor in how the
                prejudice and violence faced by trans* communities is
                different from that faced by women. Also, even though
                trans* people face greater violence than cis women in
                some situations, e.g. in custody, we still need to think
                carefully before seeking for these perpetrators to be
                gender neutral, because there is no clear jurisprudence
                around it.

        <span style="font-weight:400">A vibrant discussion followed in which participants raised an array of points:</span>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>the demand to recognize women as perpetrators/ abettors of sexual violence has also been raised in the context of violence on Dalit men and women</li>
        <li> it has been impossible to use the SC/ST POA Act in cases of casteist violence on Dalit trans* folx </li>
        <li>
        many queer/trans* groups who want gender neutrality are anti feminist, and don’t share our fight against the right wing regime, so movements will become more divided around gender specificity/ neutrality
        </li>
        <li>
        how do we factor in cultural differences – for example women living and raising kids together in Manipur are traditionally accepted, but they don’t fit into Western definitions of lesbians, etc
        </li>
        <li>we need to be clear whether, when we identify perpetrators as men, are we also including transmen who do not identify as trans?</li>
        <li>we don’t yet understand fully how the masculinity of transmen is looked at within the discourse of violence</li>
        <li>what if a cis/trans woman violates a transman, how will that violence be seen?</li>
        <li>until we are able to make people understand gender as different from the body, we will not be able to articulate the range of gendered violence or to assert that rape happens not because of our bodies, but as an assertion of power</li>
        <li>a general perception is being created of trans* people being high risk/hypersexual so if the perpetrator is made gender-neutral, most cases will be on gay men and transwomen</li>
        <li>in cases of violence on especially vulnerable sections: sex workers, members of the LGBT community with disability, transpersons from scheduled castes and tribes... it’s not just the perpetrator but the system itself that allows our bodies to be violated</li>
        <li>there are also vigilante groups of women who work with the police to attack sex workers etc</li>
        <li>more documentation of violence on trans* people
        is needed to understand its specificities, and how
        to seek protection from it. For example, since the
        police station is not a safe place for trans* people,
        do we need to think of a different point of contact
        for complaints? The reply came swiftly that
        interactions with the police are unavoidable for
        transpersons and sex workers, and often the police
        may even be the client who is violent.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>Participants also flagged other power dynamics:</b>
        Queer and trans* folks from the north east and other
        tribal areas don’t have the same access to networks of
        support, are isolated in terms of language, and do not
        possess the same social/cultural/financial capital as
        others. Which brought us to a shared understanding:
        that in addition to thinking about the law, we need to
        recognise the inequalities between us, create support
        systems for each other that bridge across them, and
        become a stronger trans-feminist voice together.
        Yet the deliberations on the law continued after lunch,
        because we felt that the morning had raised many
        questions but not helped us come to any conclusions
        on the legal front. Hence in the afternoon, we had
        a detailed, clause by clause discussion on discrimination
        and violence as defined in the Trans Bill as well
        as on Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code that
        defines “rape”. Amritananda Chakravorty, an advocate
        specializing in litigation on gender and sexuality, laid
        out options for us on how in addition to the protections
        (for whatever they are worth) that the Trans Bill offers,
        some amendments could be fought for to cover trans*
        persons who face sexual violence, while protecting the
        community from harassment.
        <br><br>
        • <b>Option 1:</b> Change the clause in Trans Bill to say
        that sexual violence against trans* persons should
        be treated at par with/as equivalent to that against
        women
        <br><br>
        • <b>Option 2:</b> Modify laws relating to sexual violence to
        include violence against people other than cis women.
        <br><br>
        In either case, continue to retain the perpetrator as
        “man” defined by the following explanation: “man”
        means a male human being who has been assigned
        male gender at birth, and who is recognised in the
        male gender.
        <br><br>
        We weighed the pros and cons of seeking changes in
        the Trans Bill versus trying to modify existing sexual
        violence laws. We talked about how the word “person”
        may/not work legally and whether something like the
        explanation drafted above for the perpetrator could
        actually help protect transmen and non operative
        transwomen from being targetted or implicated as
        perpetrators of violence. We considered how grave
        the intersectional identities of genders and religious
        or ethnic identity create greater vulnerability to
        aggravated assault. We spoke of the raw truth that
        trans* and intersex persons’ bodies are subject to
        greater scrutiny because unlike women, the notion of
        private parts/privacy is not extended to them.
        <br><br>
        On Day 2, Chayanika led a continuation of the discussion
        with a comparison of the demands for the Criminal
        Law Amendment women’s groups made in 2013 to the
        Justice Verma Committee. Back then too we had argued
        that in addition to women, the victim must also be ‘a
        person excepting a woman’ – which would include men
        and transgender persons. This brought us to:
        <br><br>
        • <b>Option 3</b> would be a two-fold strategy:<br><br>
        <div style="padding-left:20px;">
        1. To seek amendment of the Trans Bill to include a
        section on atrocities to address discrimination,
        humiliation, etc
        <br><br>
        2. To seek modifications of laws relating to sexual
        violence to include violence against people other
        than cis women. This would also include addressing
        procedural and evidentiary provisions. For
        instance, if we were to seek to amend Section 375
        on Rape, clause a) on penetration, it presently reads:
        “A man is said to commit an act of sexual violence
        on a woman if he – (a) penetrates his penis, to any
        extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of
        a woman or makes her to do so with him or any
        other person...” Instead, we would seek for it to be
        amended to read like this: (a) penetrates his penis,
        to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or
        anus or any other sexual organ of any person, such
        as surgically reconstituted genitalia, organs and/
        or removed genitalia (or some such wording) or
        makes them to do so with him or any other person.
        And so on.
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight:400">There was much to think about but on these we had an unshakeable agreement:</span>
        <br>
        <div style="padding-left:20px;">
        • Sexual violence against all people is gendered violence <br>
        • There is no hierarchy of sexual violence, but there is a specificity of experience across genders<br>
        • We are presently going to the law to address violence by cis men on all other persons.<br>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight:400">Personal Lives & Public Actions</span>
        <br><br>
        We didn’t have that much time left together but there
        was so much more to talk about. So Shals Mahajan
        (LABIA) and Bittu initiated a conversation on what
        being trans means in everyday terms – of living
        and loving, making non/monogamous partnerships
        and/or marriages, seeking custody and inheritance,
        divorce and other matters in the public domain, and
        their intersections with other identities of caste,
        class, occupation, etc. Shals said, ‘Queer and trans
        groups haven’t discussed personal laws in much detail
        unlike women’s collectives have, and it’s really time
        for us to do so.’ The Trans Bill 2019 failed to address
        marriage, partnership, property and inheritance rights
        of trans* and gender non-conforming people. It did
        not even grant the basic right to make a family. Since
        the decriminalization of 377 there have been many
        concerns around rights of queer persons vis-a-vis
        intimate partners. <b>So that morning we tried to at
        least identify the ambit of questions that need to
        asked, discussed and sought answers for.</b>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>At the core is the fight for autonomy of transpeople to gender identify on their own terms without reference from the natal family</li>
        <li>Laws relating to family are very specifically gendered, and tightly defined and allow marriage between only men and women. With NALSA, however, there is a possibility of a person getting official identification in the other binary gender. How do laws of marriage then apply to people who transition within cis marriages?</li>
        <li>What is the legal status if two trans* persons want to marry? What are their rights of custody, divorce, etc? In the event of a breakdown that turns ugly, how will the Domestic Violence (DV) Act apply? In fact, how does the DV Act apply to gender non-confirming children in natal families even today? </li>
        <li>What if after marriage one partner transitions, it then becomes a same sex marriage for which where there is no provision in law. </li>
        <li>Since most inheritance laws are unequal and gendered, what is the impact of the transition on an individual’s inheritance rights?</li>
        <li>Similarly, since right to adoption is gender specific too, which gender of the foster parent will be recognised – the assigned/identified, pre/post transition?</li>
        <li>What happens in the cases governed by customary laws especially in indigenous communities?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The discussions revealed that the attitude of the police,
        courts, religious bodies and society all varied from case
        to case, and state to state. In some cases awarding full
        recognition to trans* marriages, in some, declaring
        them null and void. There are numerous cases of
        extortion by spouses, the police, and others. In the case
        of violence within the partnership, shelter is impossible
        to find, and if you do, then there is harassment by the
        police, mistreatment, filing of elopement and abduction
        cases, verification of the “gender” by public stripping
        and other such forms of humiliation. At the village and
        community level, sometimes the best they can hope
        for is a silent acceptance. Cis-partners of trans* people
        also struggle for protection/rights and we should also
        think about them. On the other hand are schemes such
        as Kalyan Lakshmi/Shadi Mubarak of the Telangana
        government for marriage of girl children which some
        transwomen have also been able to access!
        <br><br>
        The discussion then veered away from marriage
        towards civil partnerships which are very important
        for both, feminist and queer movements. We explored
        the possibility of whether the Special Marriages Act
        could be worked with and appropriated to rethink
        about partnerships and marriage-like liaisons? We
        also discussed the need to go beyond patriarchal
        and normative structures that sanctify monogamous
        coupledom, and reproduces normativities that many
        among us may/not want. We agreed to work harder to
        get recognition for “families of choice”, maybe through
        affirming hijra gharanas that still have recognition
        in society, if not in the law. The fact that the National
        Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise that was already
        in progress in Assam, did not recognise that gharana
        as a family unit came up as a serious concern. (More
        on the CAA-NRC-NPR elsewhere in this newsletter).
        <br><br>
        On the positive side, it was shared that at several
        previous consultations including with the Law
        Commission of India, LBT groups have recommended
        all inheritance be made gender neutral; that persons
        must be free to assign legal representation status to
        persons beyond blood relatives and sexual partners
        for legal, medical, financial and other matters. And
        these are just some of the out-of-the-box ideas that
        have already come up. Because in the women’s
        movement many of our discussions and strategies
        were directed by the fact that majority of women
        were/are in marriages, but the queer/trans*
        movement has the capacity to think and imagine
        things differently. Because the fact that we break the
        gender binary holds capacity to disrupt lot of ideas of
        family, sex, etc. and think of our citizenship in more
        creative, autonomous ways.
        <br><br>
        It was on this note that the meeting was concluded, glad
        that we had begun this dialogue between the women’s
        movement and queer and trans* movements. We felt
        that we were finally moving towards a space of shared
        transfeminism that many of us had been wanting for a
        long time. But we were also fully cognizant of the need
        to respond urgently to the upcoming date when the
        Trans Bill 2019 would be tabled in the Rajya Sabha.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-weight:400">So we decided to act immediately.</span>
        <ol>
            <li>We issued a joint letter on behalf of feminists gathered at this national consultation to members of the Rajya Sabha.
                <div style="padding-top:10px">The letter, sent on 31 October 2019 reaffirmed our
                solidarity with the demands of the trans movement
                on self identification, full citizenship rights, affirmative
                action, etc. saying, <b>‘Our feminisms speak for not just
                cis-women but also for trans* persons, gender non-
                conforming and non-binary persons. We believe that
                the same structures of gendered power affect all of us.
                We thus speak as transfeminists of all genders for the
                rights of all persons marginalised by the structures
                of power that support binary gender in our lives.</b>
                Given this, we see the need for the protection of law
                given to cis-women thus far to be extended to all persons
                who are similarly marginalised while maintaining the
                specificities of our individual gender identities. From
                our collective experience over years of work on issues
                of gendered violence and oppression, we wish to raise
                a few questions around some of the provisions of the
                Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights)Bill 2019
                which is currently set to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha.’</div>
                <br>
                <b>A couple of the key recommendations are briefly reproduced here.</b>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>In the matter of violence, atrocities and offences
                        other than sexual assault must be separated
                        from issues relating to targeted sexual assault.</b>
                        Specifically on sexual assault, trans* and gender
                        non-conforming persons must be included as
                        survivors of violence with a right to redressal
                        under existing laws against sexual violence, like
                        Sections 375, 354, as well as other laws on sexual
                        harassment, stalking, etc. The punishment for these
                        crimes must also be at par with those laid out for
                        crimes against ‘women’ in these sections of the
                        IPC. Where the offender is a public servant, the
                        penalty must be higher. It is crucial that, like for
                        women, procedural and evidentiary safeguards and
                        <b>protections must be put into place for trans* and
                        gender non-conforming persons,</b> and that these
                        must be worked out in consultation with them.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                We also highlighted how much needs to be done
                before trans* and gender non-conforming persons
                can get full rights and recognition in the law.

                    realign rights vis-a-vis families and the right to

                    existing family laws and natal families as well as
                    the right of all persons to be able to form families
                    of their choosing. The family is an institution where
                    the gender roles are well defined and laws reflect
                    these notions of gender practice at the level of the
                    family even today.... <b>the laws around inheritance,

                Titled, Women’s Groups Seek Gender Justice For Trans
                And Gender Non-Conforming Persons*, the letter
                expressed shock and outrage at the fact the Trans Bill
                fails to secure the rights of transpersons, it features
                clauses that humiliate and further dispossess trans
                individuals and communities by failing to recognise the
                gendered and patriarchal nature of their oppression.
                Hence, we specifically recommended that:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Protection of all gender specific laws relating to violence against women be extended to cover trans persons.</b>

Hence sexual violence against trans persons can NOT be punished with lower sentences than equivalent sexual crimes against cisgender women.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>On violence in the natal home.</b> That the Trans
                        Bill pushes the community back into the family, and
                        makes it difficult for them to leave a violent family
                        environment is similar to the age old practice of
                        pushing ‘women’ back into their natal or marital
                        families however violent they may be! As ‘women’s
                        groups,’ we have always identified the violence
                        within hetero-patriarchal family structures, in
                        the domesticities of marital and biological ties.
                        Hence we reassert that the judicial system should

                    The Trans Bill must be strengthened on educational,
                    livelihood opportunities and other affirmative
                    actions to correct the historical discrimination and
                    exclusion of the community from the mainstream.
                    From our experience in the ‘women’s’ movement,
                    the struggle for equal opportunities and rights
                    has demonstrated that welfare measures do little
                    to empower vulnerable communities or change
                    institutionalised discriminatory practices.

                    Trans persons have very specific health needs but
                    the discrimination, insensitivity and lack of care
                    they confront on a daily basis need to be urgently
                    addressed. Our work on ‘women’s’ health, has shown
                    us the masculinist character of these systems. To our
                    long standing demand that ‘women’s’ voices be
                    heeded while dealing with their health issues, we
                    today add that trans persons must be consulted,
                    heard, and recognised as important contributors
                    towards the knowledge creation of care systems
                    that need to be put in place to address their needs,
                    and re-orient the current practice of medicine.

        <b>Other action plans</b> included building an archive of
        testimonies to give voice to different lived realities of
        trans people: creating awareness among the public,
        Rajya Sabha members and President against the
        Trans Bill in its current form, and seek they send it
        to a select committee for making vital amendments.
        Towards this, many efforts were made by groups,
        individuals, CBOs, NGOs and wider platforms across
        the country. Many state level meetings and protests
        were held. Twitter storms and post card campaigns
        were launched. Several Rajya Sabha members were
        met and submissions made to them by trans rights
        activists, and support garnered from major political
        parties such as the DMK, CPI, Congress, AITC, BJD,
        CPM, AIADMK, SP, RJD, AAP, etc. Many press releases,
        statements and memorandums were issued by queer
        and trans groups during the month of November
        2019. <b>Yet tragically, in the ways that most things
        have gone especially since May 2014, the Trans
        Bill 2019 was pushed through the Rajya Sabha on
        25th November 2019. Immediately, many queer
        and other progressive groups like the PUDR, NNSW,
        NAPM, Tamil Nadu Rainbow Coalition and others
        wrote to the President asking him to withhold his
        assent. But he nevertheless inked it into a law.</b>
        <br><br>
        In Feb 2020, a meeting of activists was held in Delhi
        where many legal and social strategies were discussed.
        It is clear that the trans community will not accept this
        law quietly. It will be challenged in the courts, on the
        streets, in practice, interpretation and in the lives of
        every transman, transwoman, and gender non-binary
        person whose life it will affect deeply. And the feminist
        dialogues and actions we have initiated will also need
        to continue – to inform us, to make our feminisms more
        trans inclusive, to carry our visions for the future truly
        beyond the binary.

            * The ‘women’ that the women’s groups have engaged with so far are
            mostly cis women, a term for women who identify with the female gender
            they were assigned at birth. We recognise today that trans persons can
            also be women or men. But a lot of the learning that we refer to in this
            document is from the lives of cis women, and so in this document we write
            ‘women’ in quotes when we refer to our earlier understanding of ‘women’.

            Footnote: As this newsletter goes to press, the government
            is hurriedly framing the rules for the Transgender
            Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2020 in the midst of
            the Corona pandemic. Giving the community just 12 days
            to submit inputs, while it is struggling against hunger
            and homelessness that the Corona related lockdown
            has caused. And as the government knows too well, a
            challenge to the Act is also pending in the Supreme Court.
            But clearly, it is determined to push through its agenda
            with little concern for the community it claims to be
            protecting with this law!

                At 11:15 am on 5 August 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that
                the President had already passed orders effectively abrogating Article 3701,
                by extending all the provisions of the Constitution to the state of Jammu and
                Kashmir (J&K). Through convoluted and unconstitutional processes and
                amendments, he then introduced the J&K Reorganisation Bill in the Parliament
                – a power that the Parliament would not have been allowed to under the
                unamended Article 370. Amid loud protests and disruption, the Bill was passed
                bifurcating the state into two Union Territories: Ladakh, and Jammu and
                Kashmir. The UT of Ladakh is under the direct control of the Union Government
                through the Lt. Governor, while the UT of J&K has a Legislative Assembly of its
                own with extremely limited powers, and is also overall under the Lt. Governor.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        The BJP government did not circulate the Bill in the House before hand,
        and the Speaker, Venkaiah Naidu allowed members of Parliament only until
        12:30 pm to propose amendments! Apparently, preparations for the move had
        been underway for months, including the imposition of President’s Rule in
        December 2018. These actions by the Home Ministry subvert both, the letter
        of the procedure laid down in Article 370 on its amendments, primary among
        which is the necessity of a Constituent Assembly to consider any amendment. It
        also violates the spirit of the Constitution, and the sovereign contract between
        India and Kashmir. And of course, the people of Kashmir themselves were
        denied any voice through this capture of state institutions and elected
        representatives, and the force of sheer state terror.
        <br><br>
        Kashmir under siege. Kashmir caged. Kashmir imprisoned. Analogies abound
        for the Indian Government‘s actions of 5 August 2019 when it unilaterally
        terminated the semi-autonomous Constitutional status granted to the region
        as a condition of its accession to India, and bifurcated it into Union Territories
        under the direct rule of the Union government. This action was preceded in
        the previous week by a military blockade, a state of undeclared emergency,
        and an unprecedented media and communications clampdown. An estimated
        4,000 <a style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/about-4000-people-arrested-in-kashmir-since-august-5-govt-sources-to-afp/article61582905.ece">Kashmiris</a> were arbitrarily detained including politicians, business
        leaders, lawyers, human rights defenders, chartered accountants, journalists,
        teachers, and students placed under administrative detention laws such as the
        Public Safety Act, 1978. The grounds of detention and whereabouts of a large
        number, including children as young as ten, remain unknown. With all leading
        mainstream opposition members placed under house arrest and leaders of the
        Kashmir movement(s) for autonomy in custody, political voices in the Kashmir
        valley were effectively strangled into silence. An unknown number of detainees
        have also been moved to prisons outside J&K. The Indian government continues
        to declare that all is ‘normal’ in the face of credible and mounting evidence of
        healthcare and humanitarian crisis, marked by civilian
        deaths, torture, molestations, as well as blindings and
        other injuries in pellet gun attacks by Indian security
        forces. On the other hand, is the severe curtailment
        of freedom of opinion, expression, and information;
        assembly and movement; and religious freedoms.

                At 365 days and counting, the situation in Kashmir
                is officially the world’s longest lockdown in any
                democracy in the world. Stringent control over news
                and information, widespread targeting of journalists
                and activists, mass imprisonment of Kashmiris in UP,
                Rajasthan, etc., deprive both the imprisoned and their
                near and dear ones visitation rights. In many cases, even
                basic information is unavailable on those simply picked
                up or ‘disappeared,’ as they more rightly say in Kashmir.

            What were the central government’s arguments to justify these actions?
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>That the revocation was enacted “to enable people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information”</li>
            <li>That abrogation would allow Indians to buy land in Kashmir, to invest in the state and get domicile.</li>
            <li>And of course that crudest claim of all made by BJP MLA Vikram Saini from Uttar Pradesh’s who said that “party workers were excited over the scrapping of Article 370 as it would now enable them to marry ‘gori’ (fair) Kashmiri girls.” See section later titled: Women of the World <i>#standwithkashmir, #standwiththewomenofkashmir</i> for our loud and clear response to these claims!</li>
        </ul> <br>
        For those of us, who despite countless narratives find it impossible to imagine what the lockdown in Kashmir has meant, imagine being in the COVID-19 lockdown without electricity, water, basic food supplies, telephone
        connections, and the internet. Slow internet was
        ‘restored’ to Kashmir 7 months after the lockdown. Even
        in the face of the deadly Corona pandemic, the state has
        disallowed 4G internet. Under such a blackout, there is
        little credible news of severe impact on health, survival,
        etc. Never mind questions of mental health impact,
        education, etc., on the people.
        <br><br>
        The horror stories of Kashmiris in quarantine
        started emerging as early as in April 2020: “Over
        230 Kashmiri students shifted from Tehran (Iran)
        to Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) on the 15th of March have
        been quarantined at the Army Wellness Centre. While
        most of these students had already spent a month in
        quarantine in their Universities and hostels in Iran,
        an extended quarantine due to the international
        journey sounds justified. However, it is unknown and
        concerning as to why they were not taken to a wellness
        centre or shelter in J&K. Most of them have been tested
        and found negative for Covid-19 infection. But the
        manner of their quarantine and isolation in Rajasthan
        has already caused many of them severe panic attacks
        and other illnesses. “We are huddled together and
        at times mixed with positive cases. Many of us have
        started taking medicine for the panic attacks. If not
        Covid-19, the growing anxiety will kill us”, a MBBS
        student at the facility told a reporter of The Hindu over
        phone.” (6 April 2020)<sup style="font-size:10px;font-weight:400;">2</sup>
        <br><br>
        In the midst of all this, the Indian state has continued
        to implement new laws and policies in the valley. The
        Jammu and Kashmir Re-organisation Act and Domicile
        Law 2019, the J&K Education Investment Policy 2020,
        the new Media Policy 2020, and the Real Estate Policy
        2020 were also introduced during this period. Finally, a
        committee has been set up to frame a policy document
        that can allow for land acquisition to be undertaken
        for the needs of the army, for outside investment and
        for projects such as the Srinagar Smart City. As the
        former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted, “Talk
        about suspect timing. At a time when all our efforts and
        attention should be focused on the COVID-19 outbreak,
        the government slips in a new domicile law for J&K.
        Insult is heaped on injury...” Then again, that has been
        the story of Kashmir, for far too long.
        <br><br>
        The silencing of voices in support of the people of the
        Kashmir valley continued all the way to the capital
        city. When the first citizen’s report on lockdown titled
        <b>‘Kashmir Caged – A Fact-Finding Report’</b> by Jean
        Drèze, Kavita Krishnan, Maimoona Mollah and Vimal Bhai was released at a press conference in Delhi, the
        Press Club wouldn’t allow them to screen a video
        report that accompanied the textual one. This, of
        course, caused a huge furore about censorship by the
        government and the pressure it relentlessly exercises
        to quash the truth emerging from Kashmir.

                On 6 July 2020, a photo of a 3 year old child sitting on
                his dead grandfather put Kashmir on edge. The child’s
                65-year-old grandfather, Bashir Ahmed, was allegedly
                shot in a gunbattle between the Indian security forces
                and militants who were believed to belong to the
                Lashkar-e-Taiba. Instead of acknowledging that the gun
                battle put families and children at a grave risk, the J&K
                police officials tweeted a photograph of the same boy
                with a security personnel, claiming he was ‘rescued’
                from ‘getting hit by bullets during terrorist attack!’
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        If the camera showed the whizzing of bullets and killing
        of people in the valley, the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of
        Civil Society & Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons report revealed what else is ongoing that is
        not in the frame. According to this bi-annual report on
        the situation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir,
        the period from 1 January - 30 June 2020 witnessed:
        <ul>
            <li>at least 229 killings in different incidents of violence, including children and women</li>
            <li>at least 107 Cordon and Search Operations (CASOs) followed by 57 encounters took place, resulting in the killing of 143 militants, vandalism and destruction of civilian properties by Indian armed forces</li>
            <li>media continued to be under pressure and intimidation by the authorities, with several incidents of violence on journalists, and charging them under stringent laws</li>
            <li>4G mobile internet services, banned on 5 August 2019 continued to be suspended. In addition, 55 instances of internet blockades were recorded</li>
            <li>the destruction of civilian properties during encounters saw an increase during the COVID-19 lockdown, rendering many families homeless.</li>
        </ul>
        In the midst of all of this violence, the valley is also
        affected by the pandemic. And rather than extending
        support to the administration with the aim to save
        lives, the Indian state is still focussed on severely
        curtailing the rights and liberties of the people in
        the valley. While India is now in Unlock Phase 2.0,
        it seems Kashmir is in Lock-up Phase 2.0 with a
        heightened militaristic approach to the pandemic
        in force. Blockading of red zones with iron bars
        fixed in concrete, the application of anti-insurgency
        technologies to monitor the movement of ordinary
        people, the use of drones for aerial surveillance,
        detentions, arrests and the seizing of assets,
        continued restrictions of internet affecting access to
        vital medical information as well as harassment of
        medical doctors and staff have all been undertaken
        by the Indian state.

                What does the Kashmiri do? No matter where they
                go, India violates their existence. From the streets of
                Jaipur to those in Srinagar. From outside their doors
                in Mumbai to within the doors of their homes. From
                in front of the hospital to on the hospital bed where
                medical services are curtailed. Likewise, from when
                a grandfather is shot dead to when the child is given
                sweets. “Smash that frame that New Delhi wants us
                to see Kashmir through. What India is doing in the
                valley has one frame alone and that is the frame of
                occupation.”

        peace, civil and democratic rights’ activists, lawyers,
        academics, students, journalists, scientists, artists, and
        writers, etc, raised their voices in salute and solidarity
        with the women of Kashmir. Issuing a statement from
        30 countries across the globe – ranging from South
        Asian nations to the U.S, Iran to Indonesia, Afghanistan
        to Argentina, Europe to Mexico, Israel, Palestine,
        Uganda, Nigeria and South Africa – they declared their
        determination to stand with Kashmir in this, its darkest
        moment. The following is an excerpt of Statement
        issued simultaneously in New Delhi and New York on
        27 September 2019.

        ‘On 30 August 2019, the United Nations’ International
        Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances,
        Parveena Ahangar, mother of the 16 year old Javaid
        who was ‘disappeared’ by paramilitary forces in
        Kashmir in 1990 mourned again.

        are not alone in our grief. Yet this year we have
        been strangled, and there was no coming together

        For, ‘on the appointed day, when India slept, the people of Kashmir awoke to curfew and unfreedom. On the
        appointed day, a group of criminals among those assembled in Ayodhya basked in the freedom they have to build
        a temple – their temple, and not Rama’s and certainly not India’s – despite belonging in prison for having planned
        and orchestrated the demolition of a mosque that stood in its place for over four centuries.... August 5 – the date
        chosen consciously by baleful men to humiliate the people of India whose independence on August 15 they
        never fought for – will go down in history as a day that celebrates the triumph of vandalism and destruction over

        #KashmirCivilDisobedience - A Citizens’
        Report by Anirudh Kala, Brinelle D’Souza,
        Revati Laul, and Shabnam Hashmi, stands
        contrary to other fact finding reports in
        how it understands the big picture. As
        the introduction says, “...Kashmir is on
        edge - humiliated, angry, disturbed and
        ‘disrobed,’ as a journalist who spoke to
        us described it. The fact that there
        has been no violence has to do with
        the resilience of the people. It is an
        active and collective choice being
        exercised each day, to observe
        a civil disobedience. In feeling
        rejected and betrayed by the
        Indian state, Kashmiris have
        chosen to respond back,
        through a largely non-violent
        protest.”<br>

                Kashmir’s special status goes back to 1947 when its then ruler had joined the Indian Union on certain conditions. Article 370 outlined the
                contours of these conditions – one of them being the power Kashmir had to decide all its matters except for foreign affairs, defence, finance and
                communications. An intrinsic part of Article 370 was Article 35A which defined the state’s permanent resident.

        As a women’s group that has been fighting violence against women for decades,
        seeking justice, safety and social awareness against crimes on women, we
        unequivocally condemn the execution of the four convicts of the December 2012
        case of gang rape and murder. For many this may seem to be a contradiction, but
        not to us in the feminist movement. Though the hanging comes as a setback for
        our fight for life and justice, it is a moment to remind ourselves why this inhuman
        practice continues to prevail in our criminal justice system.
        <br><br>
        Ask yourself, is it safe for women to be out there since the death sentence
        awarded to Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, and Akshay Kumar
        convicted of the December 2012 gangrape and murder? Or even since their
        execution on 20 March 2020?

                It has been repeatedly established by studies worldwide that capital punishment
                has failed to work as a deterrent for sexual crimes yet the cry for death in
                the name of justice grows louder. The truth is that even after the Indian state
                executed Auto (Gowri) Shankar in 1995, Ranga and Billa (Kuljeet Singh and
                Jasbir Singh) in 1982, and Dhananjay Chatterjee in 2004 for rape/s and murder,
                sexual assaults and killings have continued unabated. The awarding of the death
                penalty to the four convicts of the December 2012 did not prevent Kathua case
                of 2018, the Unnao case of 2017, or the Kanpur case of January 2020. That’s
                because the death penalty is NOT a deterrent to violent crimes. It never has
                been. If anything, it motivates rapists to turn into murderers in order to get
                rid of evidence, the most recent example being the gang rape and murder of a
                veterinary doctor in Hyderabad. The subsequent ‘encounter’ of all four accused
                by the police was questionable to say the least. On social media, many righteous
                beings celebrated the actions of the police, for bringing justice to the brutes for
                their inhuman crime. But this was nothing but a travesty of justice. We cannot
                equate/mistake revenge for justice. We would be fools to believe that the death
                penalty is the answer to crimes against women - for it only kills the rapist and
                not the rape culture.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        According to the ‘Death Penalty India Report, 2016’, a very high percentage of
        men unprivileged by caste, class and religion are sentenced to death, while those
        belonging to the upper castes and classes, perpetrators within the family, friends,
        neighbours, godmen, teachers and other acquaintances (rape by strangers is
        just about 1% of the total reported cases) often don’t even face a trial. Not to
        mention marital rape which remains a contentious issue not just within families,
        but within the law as well. In addition, are the heinous sexual crimes against
        women from Dalits and adivasi communities, ethnic and religious minorities as
        well as highly vulnerable groups such as women with disabilities, sex workers,
        transpersons, and gender non-conforming persons for whom even getting an
        FIR registered can be impossible. Not surprisingly, therefore, reporting of sexual
        crimes remains abysmally low. In all these instances, the process of seeking justice
        is severely stacked against victims/survivors, and the
        conviction rate for reported sexual crimes remains as
        low as 26%. Consequently, most perpetrators of sexual
        violence enjoy a high degree of impunity, including being
        acquitted of all charges, which we believe is the greatest
        cause for the continued prevalence of such violence.
        <br><br>
        The outcry for execution of rape convicts actually
        prevents our society and the State from addressing and
        taking responsibility for the culture of sexual violence.
        At a press conference held by the Coalition Against
        Sexual Violence and the Death Penalty (of which Saheli
        is a part) on 24 January 2020, activists emphasized
        that the death penalty shifts the focus away from the
        violence faced by women in everyday lives. The state,
        police and courts do little to remedy that and continue
        to resort to the instrumental use of the death sentence
        under the garb of “rights of the victim”. Kavita Krishnan,
        secretary, All-India Progressive Women’s Association,
        said that, “An execution falsely reassures us that rape
        is a ‘rarest of the rare’ act committed by strangers or
        beasts. In fact, rapists are usually not strangers, but
        men we know and admire - and rape is a product of
        our patriarchal society, not an isolated rare instance.”
        The selective outrage evoked only for certain cases
        without considering the misogyny embedded in the
        social and political fabric gives rise to a misplaced
        sense of justice in public opinion. Advocate Tara Narula,
        member, Women in Criminal Law Association, spoke
        about the problems within the criminal justice system
        that need to be fixed right from the stages of reporting,
        investigation, and forensic examination, as well as in
        relation to the victim support mechanisms which are
        presently unavailable. Enakshi Ganguly, co-founder,
        Haq Centre for Child Rights, shared the impediments
        that child survivors of sexual violence face when
        accessing justice. According to her, the introduction of
        death penalty to this context only deters reporting of
        an offence that is already under reported because most
        perpetrators (over 90%) are known persons. Sudeeti,
        member, Pinjra Tod, said that the demand for death
        penalty for the rape convicts operates on the principle
        of externalizing the problem of sexual violence in our
        everyday structures and lives, and locates it on a handful
        of convicts identified in the most publicized and brutal
        rape cases. Vani Subramanian from Saheli highlighted
        women’s heightened vulnerability in times of conflict,
        and sought an end to the impunity with which the state
        itself uses sexual violence as an instrument of control
        on women. And Neetika Viswanath of the National law
        University Delhi alerted us that the disproportionate
        public attention on sentencing distracts from all the

        problems inherent in the criminal justice system, and
        hence prevents victim/survivors from redressal and
        justice. It was collectively affirmed that the criminal
        justice system needs to strengthen processes of
        investigation, sensitize the police and the judiciary,
        and build victim support mechanisms instead of
        focusing entirely on punishments. Building on the
        recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee in
        2013, the Coalition demanded:
        <ul>
            <li>Increasing the strength of judges for timely and fair disposal of cases</li>
            <li>Insulation of police from political or other extraneous
            influence for better performance, regardless of
            their jurisdiction. Mandatory intervention of police
            officials to help victims, punishment to police
            officials who refused to register FIR or abandon the
            investigation</li>
            <li>Training of police officials and medical professionals
            while investigating and treating victims with care
            and dignity. Mandatory immediate medical help to
            victims even by the private hospitals</li>
            <li>Protection of victims and witnesses</li>
            <li>Disqualification of candidates from electoral process if pending trial for sexual offences</li>
            <li>Encouraging street vending to make bus stops and
                footpaths safe for communities and pedestrians,
                adequate street lighting at all places</li>
            <li>Amendments to the existing school curriculum to
            include a component of sexuality education and
            gender sensitization to psychologically reconstruct
            psyche of Indian male</li>
        </ul>
        There are no quick answers to stopping sexual crimes.
        We believe that death penalty represents our collective
        failure as a society. We need to walk together on the
        long and complicated path to dismantling patriarchal
        and caste/community-based privileges, impunity and
        power. The only way forward is through changes in
        policy and law, and social awareness by breaking the
        silence on these heinous crimes. And we hope that it
        leads towards a society based on equality and justice,
        not revenge and retribution.

                “I am surprised as to how Justice Ranjan Gogoi,
                who once exhibited such courage of conviction
                to uphold the independence of the judiciary,
                has compromised the noble principles on the
                independence and impartiality of the judiciary,”</a>
                said retired Justice Kurian Thomas, when the former
                Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi took oath as
                a member of the Rajya Sabha, nominated by the ruling
                Bhartiya Janata Party.
                <br><br>
                Justice Thomas’ shock was believable. After all, barely
                two years before the swearing in, on 12 January 2018
                to be precise, Gogoi had been one of four Supreme
                Court (SC) judges, along with Justices Kurian Joseph,
                Jasti Chelameswar and Madan Lokur who, in an
                unprecedented move, held a press conference to warn
                the country of the dangers of political interference
                in the judiciary. 
                <a style="font-weight:400; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/democracy-in-india-at-stake-top-judges-after-failed-meet-with-chief-justice-1799197">
                “We are all convinced that unless
                this institution is preserved and it maintains its
                equanimity, democracy will not survive in this
                country.” </a>
                <br><br>
                But it seems that their press conference was a prophecy
                of the times to come. The evidence of which lies in what
                happened between then and the moment of Gogoi’s
                nomination to the Rajya Sabha.
                <br><br>
                <b>A complaint of sexual harassment at the Supreme Court comes in.</b>
                <br><br>
                In the heat of the summer of 2019, just before the
                Supreme Court closed for vacation, a woman, let’s call
                her K, wrote to all 22 sitting judges of the Supreme
                Court alleging two incidents of sexual harassment
                by Justice Gogoi, both of which allegedly took place
                in October 2018, days after he was appointed as the
                CJI. Instead of following the law on sexual harassment
                at the workplace, the Supreme Court set up an in-
                house committee comprising of three judges, junior
                to the Chief Justice. Further, she was denied the
                terms of reference of the inquiry and legal assistance,
                which compelled her to withdraw herself from the
                proceedings. Yet the committee continued its hearing
                in her absence, and even denied her a copy of its report.
                All she got on 6 May 2019, was word via the press, that
                the committee headed by the close friend of the CJI,
                Justice Bobde, had declared there was “no substance
                in the allegation contained in the complaint.”
                <br><br>
                K was fired, two male members of her family were
                suspended from their jobs – one in the courts, one with
                the Delhi Police. In a statement, K said, <i>“Today, my worst
                fears have come true, and all hopes of justice and redress
                from the highest Court of the land have been shattered.”</i>
                <br><br>
                As activists from women’s groups and civil society
                members, who have, since the late 1970s, engaged with
                issues of justice, rights, and law reforms, specifically
                those related with women, sexual violence and sexual
                harassment of women at the workplace, we said, <b>“Today
                we are facing an unprecedented crisis of credibility
                vis-à-vis the Supreme Court. In dealing with a
                complaint of sexual harassment against the Chief
                Justice, the court has failed to give the complainant
                a fair hearing. Disregarding her request for a
                ‘special enquiry committee’, the Supreme Court
                instead set up an in-house Committee comprising
                of three judges who are junior to the Chief Justice.
                The irony of this case is that the enquiry report was
                submitted to the accused, Chief Justice, which of
                course exonerated him.
                <br><br>
                We stand in solidarity with the complainant.</b> We
                vehemently reject this conclusion as it has been arrived
                at without adherence to norms of a fair and independent
                enquiry. The procedure followed in this case not only
                stands in utter violation of principles of natural justice,
                but also in contravention with both, the letter and spirit
                of Vishakha Judgment and the Sexual Harassment of
                Women at Workplace Act 2013 (henceforth POSH Act)
                which seek to recognize and mitigate disbalances of
                power at the workplace.
                <br><br>
                <b>We are utterly dismayed and shocked by this blatant
                abuse of power</b> exercised by the highest constitutional
                authority, the Supreme Court of India.
                <br><br>
                <b>We are also aware and would like to bring this to
                the notice of citizens</b> of India that the complainant
                and her family are under threat and intimidation.
                <br><br>
                <b>We are proponents of independence of the
                judiciary</b> and understand and respect that completely.
                However, we also believe that pointing out any lapses
                in the system of justice, so that it may be rectified, is in
                fact protecting this independence and not interference
                in procedures.
                <br><br>
                <b>We are aghast that twenty two years after the
                Vishakha Judgment and six years after the passing
                of the Act, there are no clear procedures laid down
                to address complaints of sexual harassment against
                the CJI, sitting and retired Judges of the Supreme
                Court.</b> The assumption that this does not happen at this
                level has been belied by the recent complaints that have
                come up against sitting judges across the country. In any
                case, the judicial system needs to follow the law and lay
                down appropriate procedures. And in the absence of
                such laid out procedures, they must adhere to the spirit
                of the law in force. That is where the Supreme Court has
                currently failed itself, and the nation.
                <br><br>
                <b>Today is a dark and sad day. The Supreme Court
                has told us that when it comes to one of its own,
                imbalances of power don’t matter, due process
                doesn’t matter, and basic norms of justice don’t
                matter. The ripple effect that this will now have
                across the board can well be imagined: if the
                guardian of the rule of law, and the institution that
                is supposed to be a moral exemplar to the nation,
                acts in this way, then why should anyone else act
                differently? And with what face can a court tell
                them to act differently, given its own conduct?
                <br><br>
                As women and other marginalized sections of
                society,</b> we do not have access to any societal power and
                turn to Courts expecting that we can get a fair hearing
                there. Khap panchayats and other mechanisms that
                function on ideas of “social morality of the powerful” are
                not where we seek justice. We have kept our faith in the
                judicial constitutional mechanisms for access to justice.
                <br><br>
                <b>We urge the Supreme Court to correct its own
                course and undo the gross injustice done to this
                complainant.</b> Moreover, this case has exposed the
                urgent need for just, transparent and fair procedures
                to be laid down as soon as possible, so that the
                highest judicial powers may also be brought into the
                framework of accountability to the laws of the land.”
                <br><br>
                As women’s rights groups and activists we also issued an
                open letter to retired judges appealing to them to “speak
                out on the side of justice and fairness. What is at stake
                here, is not only the rights of women, but also credibility of the Supreme Court. It is to protect this
                system that has been painstakingly created by the diligence of many members of the judiciary.”

                But the ‘justices’ of the Supreme Court remained silent. The only sitting judge to speak out
                was Justice D. Y. Chandrachud who sought a full court hearing to remedy the grievances which
                led to K’s withdrawal from the probe, saying that the probe panel should have the presence
                of external member. Others to speak out openly against the brazen injustice of proceedings in
                the Supreme Court were retired judges such as A. P. Shah, and Madan Lokur.
                <br><br>
                As for the CJI himself, he launched a counter attack on K saying her allegations were
                ‘unbelievable’ and that she had a ‘criminal background’. Who was to ask the CJI why, if that was
                his judgment of her character, had he employed her both, at the Supreme Court premises as
                well as his home office? Of course, he also alleged that K’s complaint was a plot to deactivate
                the office of the CJI!
                <br><br>
                The weight of the system also stood firmly with the CJI. The moment the news of this complaint
                broke, the then Union Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley said in his blog, “It’s time to stand up with
                the judiciary” and added that, “if those who peddle falsehood to destroy the institution are
                not dealt with in an exemplary manner, this trend will only accelerate.” Not a word on justice,
                on the right to a fair trial, or any of the values that the Supreme Court is meant to stand for.
                <br><br>
                So honestly, many of us were most un-surprised when Ranjan Gogoi was offered and had
                accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination. It was a relief actually, because the quid pro quo was
                there for all to see – even to those who criticised us for standing with the 35 year old junior
                court assistant in her complaint against the Chief Justice.

                <b>Section 144 and our flash protests.</b>
                <br><br>
                All of us who were protesting across the country against this travesty of justice, found ourselves
                also facing the wrath of the establishment. Day after day, we were forced to hold flash protests,
                be it outside the Supreme Court, in marketplaces, at public venues... before we were ruthlessly
                hauled off to a police station and held in detainment until the evening on the accusation that
                we had violated Section 144!
                <br><br>
                Journalists, lawyers, protestors young and old, we continued our sloganeering, singing, tweeting,
                writing and making sure we were heard far and wide, and our resistance to lawless lawmakers
                seen and understood, from protests to projections!

                We were compelled to do all we could. For we drew strength and inspiration from K who had come
                forward and spoken out despite the stark imbalance of power weighted against her. She rose against multiple
                vulnerabilities — of being a woman, of belonging to a Scheduled Caste, of having a hearing disability, of being a
                junior court assistant up against the highest constitutional authority in the judiciary, of speaking truth to power.
                <br><br>
                Even as we sought justice for K, we urged the Supreme Court to establish credible mechanisms so that all judges
                can be held accountable in accordance with the Vishakha guidelines (1997) and the POSH Act (2013).
                <br><br>
                <b>The twists that reveal the real tale!</b>
                <br><br>
                A series of curious turns followed as soon as Gogoi vacated the office of the CJI.<br><br>
                The cases against K’s family members were dropped. Two weeks after the Delhi police filed its closure report in the
                cheating case against K, a Delhi court closed the criminal proceedings. And to top it all, K was magically reinstated
                in her job. And that’s not all. Gogoi took oath as a Rajya Sabha member. Sweet payback surely for other injustices
                he committed on his way out of the Supreme Court: Heading a five-member constitution bench that delivered
                a ‘unanimous’ judgment deciding the fate of the Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya completely in favor of Hindus;
                heading the bench that put SC’s stamp of approval on the Rafale fighter jet deal between India and France clearing
                the BJP government of serious corruption charges; ensuring that the SC dragged its feet in setting up hearings
                on the violations of civil rights in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 by the Modi government; and of
                course, pushing the pace of the NRC project in Assam, despite all the loopholes, and evidence of widespread
                rights’ violations. <b>“Supreme Court of Injustice not Supreme Court of India”</b> as one of the placards said.<br><br>

                <b>From national protests to a national consultation</b><br><br>
                Consequent to the events reported above, many women’s groups and civil rights organizations in Delhi who
                had been active during these protests, got together to call a “National Consultation on Sexual Harassment at the
                Workplace (SHW) and Judicial Accountability (JA)”. As the concept note said, “The recent case involving the CJI
                poses a specific challenge for the progressive women’s movement with respect to how to seek accountability of
                the higher judiciary while fighting to protect its independence. Courts must be held to the same standards as
                any workplace with respect to gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Testimonies of the deep sexism
                and patriarchal culture that pervades the space are compounded by the culture of confidentiality that cloaks the
                judiciary. The current case draws our attention to the protections which place the higher judiciary beyond the
                pale of the laws of the land, even when there is abuse of authority for sexual benefit. Our efforts to strengthen
                judicial integrity and accountability need to recognize sexual harassment as a violation of service conditions, as
                well as of values of independence, impartiality, fairness, integrity, propriety, and equality. To end the culture of
                impunity and abuse of power for sexual benefit, new standards of judicial integrity and accountability are needed
                to address sexual harassment by sitting judges of the Supreme Court... When the highest legal authority in the
                country brazenly violates legal norms, it sends a clear message to every institution that the law exists on paper
                only, and that sexual violence, harassment, and abuse is the entitlement of those in power. The ripple effect of
                this case on women and transgender people in all kinds of workplaces (and other spaces where we face violence
                and discrimination) will no doubt soon begin to be seen.”

                “As women, transgender people and other marginalised communities, the courts have been our main recourse
                against societal and structural inequalities, discrimination and violence. We believe that the challenge today is
                for us not to be cowed down by the fact that the higher judiciary cannot be held accountable except through
                Parliamentary impeachment or via the President’s Office. As civil, democratic, labour and women’s rights
                activists and organisations, we have always thought out of the box, spoken against and beyond societal norms,
                and challenged the notion of what is acceptable – sometimes even to ourselves and our saathis. It’s time for us
                to do that again today. Together.”
                <br><br>
                Over two days of consultations in July 2019, we affirmed our commitment to short as well as long term strategies
                on JA and SHW, Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act (POSH); working together to build the “anatomy of sexual
                harassment” and the working of POSH; to feminize judicial accountability campaigns, work with retired judges/
                eminent jurists to explore alternatives, study international mechanisms and propose ways forward, and most
                importantly, to build cross-solidarities that strengthen understanding of how sexual harassment is experienced
                differently by cis, trans and queer folks across caste, class and occupation, and to build campaigns of support for
                complainants and their supporters.

        The meeting began with an introduction by Bebaak
            collective members. The meeting brought in women
            with their grassroots experiences of democratic
            struggles from 11 states in the last 6 months - Zameen
            se Zoom tak. More than 130 participants attended the
            meeting. About 15 women from different states spoke
            about their political activism with great understanding
            and articulation of issues at hand. Most of these women
            were young working women from different sectors of
            economy, mostly urban, from middle and lower middle
            class backgrounds and many were young students in
            different universities. Five questions were posed to
            the panelists who zoomed in from cities across India:
            Jaipur, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune,
            Patna, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, and Delhi. The questions
            helped them reflect and focus on their answers
            succinctly given the limited time to speak. These
            questions were – how did they see their journey from
            the home to the public arena; how did they understand
            ‘Azaadi’ and slogans of ‘Zindabad’ in their lives, what is
            the meaning of ‘Constitution’ to them, what are their
            experiences of being part of Muslim community on
            citizenship rights, what are other questions/demands
            in the present times. Through these questions, these
            activists shared their experiences of political activism
            and struggles undertaken in the last many months
            protesting the CAA-NRC across various states of India
            and through various modes of protests, slogans and
            speeches, songs, poetry, art, theatre and other creative
            modes. The following were some of the issues raised
            by the panelists:

                    <b>A New Politics for Women</b> - Many women said that
                    before coming out in the last six months, they always
                    understood their role as common people, dedicated to
                    the needs of families and homes. They never thought
                    that coming out to do political work – in the form of
                    protests and asserting their rights on roads is their
                    work. Some said that they had never gone for any
                    protest before December protests began. This coming
                    out of their homes was very spontaneous. Some said
                    that they saw such large number of women on roads
                    protesting for their rights for the first time. This was
                    so energizing and inspiring. Some urban based and
                    a little educated women said that they felt that they
                    needed to learn a lot from the women who were coming
                    for these protests – their confidence, conviction and
                    understanding of issues. They spoke so well from their
                    life experiences. They saw a meaning for themselves
                    in these protests. Many women organized their lives
                    and their house work in a manner that they could go
                    for protests.</li><br>
                    <li>
                    <b>Meaning of Constitution and Azaadi in their Lives</b>
                    - How they understood these protests, azaadi and
                    constitution. One woman said that during anti NRC-
                    CAA protests she realised that women need to get out
                    of their houses for Inquilaab- that is for ‘change’ and
                    we need to use two tools – of asking questions and by
                    writing – kalam se. They said – shayari, kavita, literature
                    aur revolution ka bada connection hai. Women who
                    came to these protests had fire with in them and a lot
                    needed to learnt from them. But this coming out was
                    not just for protesting against CAA but because of
                    and against their suppression for thousands of years.
                    Some said that within the Muslim community women
                    are very repressed, but it was for the first time that
                    Muslim women came out in such large numbers and
                    for the first time pronounced the word ‘Samvidhaan’.
                    They felt that NRC and CAA actually hit at the base of
                    the Constitution – and this is very dangerous. While
                    religion is our personal matter, Constitution is supreme
                    and governs us publicly. One woman said, ‘I need this
                    constitution as a Muslim in this country as only this
                    protects my rights.’ These protests have broken the
                    internal chains of women also and that is why both the
                    State and our men are afraid of us. As one woman said,
                    ‘This political experience was very liberating’.
                    <br><br>
                    We have to resist from home, another woman said.
                    Azaadi will begin when our shackles from home are
                    broken. The issues of rape with in marriage – of non-consensual sex need to be raised. While we understand
                    secularism as respect for all religions, the issue of reform
                    of religion is still not talked about. Religion needs to be
                    seen as spiritual connection with the supreme but at the
                    same time questioning of oppressive aspects of religion
                    also needs to be done. ‘Feminism and secularism have
                    to go together- these are no separate struggles.’
                    <br><br>
                    Some said that they realized that the questions of
                    identity <i>(pehchaan)</i> and citizenship are highly political
                    issues. We live with many identities and within these
                    identities our identity as Muslim women in a masculine
                    dominated space is one. With these protests we also
                    moved beyond just exercizing our voting rights. These
                    protests also highlighted that a new kind of politics is
                    emerging and people are responding differently. One
                    woman said that in their city, Hyderabad, they have
                    joined with other women’s groups and transgender
                    groups and have organised many flash protests together.
                    <br><br>
                    Another woman said that from these protests, we have
                    started thinking about our rights in a very positive
                    manner. The slogan of ‘azaadi’ has acquired a new
                    meaning in their lives. There is a new life within us. As
                    one woman said that – <i>‘Shaheen Bagh se activist ban
                    gayi hoon’</i>. We cannot lose this politics.</li><br>
                    <li>
                    <b>The Question of Identities:</b> Some said that they
                    realised that the questions of identity (pehchaan) and
                    citizenship are highly political issues. The identity
                    raised here is of ‘astitva’ their core existence. One of
                    them said, we live with many identities, as a Muslim
                    but also a citizen of this country, and within this our
                    identity as Muslim women in a masculine dominated
                    space too. With these protests we also moved beyond
                    just exercizing our voting rights. These protests also
                    highlighted that a new kind of politics is emerging and
                    people are responding differently. In Kolkata, what
                    emerged in the streets was ‘the fire from the homes –
                    <i>gharelu aag!</i>’ said a student, who herself released her
                    frustrations through slogans, questions she raised,
                    and the speeches she gave. When she raised issues
                    of marital rape, and non-consensual sex, the men
                    objected, but she said the women in the audience were
                    in agreement with me, and they went silent. We cannot
                    be reduced to our religious identities. Secularism is
                    about introspection. See the slogan in the US, ‘I can’t
                    breathe’<sup style="font-weight:500;font-size:10px;">1</sup>
                    , similarly, <i>‘Mera dam ghut-ta hai!’</i><br><br>
                    <li><b>Brutality of police</b> not just during the protests but
                    even before and after the protests were brought down
                    due to lockdown, was another important issue that
                    was raised by many women. During the protests police
                    was heartless and inhuman – many times they used
                    to throw away our food, used to take away our quilts,
                    throw water on us in those extremely cold nights of
                    December and January. Someone reported that one
                    night a child died of extreme cold. Students from JNU
                    and especially Jamia faced a lot of repression from
                    Police. And this brutality and harassment continues
                    even now as they continue to receive threatening calls
                    or they come and knock on our houses creating terror
                    amongst us.
                    <br><br>
                    Many mentioned about brutality of police on Jamia
                    students and media’s role in this. One student said
                    that the attack on Jamia students terrified her. She
                    said being a student of Humanities she used to ask
                    many questions on democracy, citizenship rights and
                    NRC/CAA protests in class. After police attack on
                    Jamia, she decided to organize a protest in her college
                    condemning the attack on the students. Her teachers
                    and Principal summoned her for doing this. She felt
                    what is taught in class rooms on democracy and its
                    practice are two different things. She felt that as a
                    Muslim protesting against NRC and CAA she had a
                    choice only between a jail and detention centre. But she
                    joined protests outside her college and started making
                    public speeches. Going out of her city to various other
                    places exposed her to new realities of life. She started
                    understanding gender stereotypes and also became
                    aware of issues of minorities in India and the need to
                    work on issues of education, religion and caste. Many
                    others said that these protests trained them and they
                    felt that their lives cannot remain limited to family
                    and homes.</li><br>

                    <li><b>Creative contributions:</b> There was a lot of creativity
                    that came out in political form during these protests.
                    Writing slogans, writing poems/shayari, making
                    posters, street plays or skits and many such things.
                    Actually these protests opened spaces for women to
                    express themselves creatively, earlier all these spaces
                    were dominated by men. Many women recited their
                    own shayari during the meeting which was so inspiring
                    and which also highlighted as to what was going
                    inside them. A JNU student narrated her experience
                    of the use of poetry and slogans and how she and
                    her co-activists titled it – Zanana ka Zamana and did
                    a lot of performances at various protest sites. How
                    they worked on the idea of secularism and how they
                    discussed the divisions amongst women on the basis
                    of being Dalit, Muslim, Hindu etc.</li></br>
                    <li><b>Men’s Responses:</b> The presentations also raised the
                    issue of support of men during these protests. Many felt
                    this support was crucial for them to come out though
                    this did not mean it was easy to be out and protesting.
                    Like finishing housework to be part of protests was
                    something which indicated that men were not sharing
                    housework but allowed women to go out and protest
                    after they had fulfilled their domestic responsibilities.
                    Some said that male support was there though this did
                    not mean that their patriarchal thinking had changed.</li></br>
                    <li><b>Other Challenges:</b> They realized that their protest
                    cannot remain limited to anti CAA-NRC-NPR issues.
                    Other issues pertaining to their daily lives like roads,
                    water, education, health, employment etc. need to be
                    addressed. And in order to address this, a mahaul of
                    AMAN, SHANTI and NYAY needs to be created. It was
                    also suggested that there is need to bring in younger
                    generation and also to connect with workers and
                    peasants. Lockdown has impacted the livelihoods of
                    the poor in a major way and we need to address these
                    economic issues. Lives matter and we have to think
                    of all lives. The experiences of women on roads have
                    been very scary.</li></br>
                    <li><b>Young women who participated</b> in these protests,
                    their leadership roles need to be developed. Many
                    raised the issue that it is important to see how these
                    women will shape politics. Coming out of restricted
                    spaces of home and becoming part of the protests and
                    raising issues of citizenship opened a wider horizon
                    for women who are able to make connections between
                    their daily oppression within families, the idea of
                    freedom and azaadi for them, how it required political
                    awareness and the need to come out and be in political
                    spaces, how to make connections between democratic
                    rights, citizenship rights, secularism and feminism
                    but also to carry forward the struggles for livelihood,
                    employment, education, health and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    The challenge is to keep this leadership of the
                    women ongoing. Even now husbands control many
                    women, as they need permission from them to step
                    out of the house. Our challenge, said an activist
                    from Bihar, is how to get younger women to join in.
                    Symbolic protests are continuing, but we have to
                    work on minorities’ futures, through education and
                    communication and keep up the dialogue! In Kolkata,
                    they kept up a digital campaign in the 74 days of the
                    lockdown, as they realised that lockdown helps the
                    State and dominant forces. Public memory is generally
                    short, so we keep reminding them of many things! We
                    have suffered enough through notebandi, lockdown,
                    and we want to urge the government to restore
                    health, education, and jobs rather than see us all in
                    our religious identities! People have begun to realise
                    it is not an identity issue.
                    <br><br>
                    The meeting ended with some exhilarating poetry and
                    songs, after nearly 3 hours of conversation!!

        The un-lockdown is under way, and some privileged ones like us sit in our homes working and watching and
            reading day after day about the endless cruelty that is being heaped all around us. On migrant workers who walked
            miles and miles in their desperation to return home, on informal sector workers who have not had a decent meal
            to eat, and nowhere to call home. While we sink further into our misery, our thoughts move back and forth on all
            that has transpired in the last many months: what happened to all the anti CAA-NRC-NPR protestors hounded and
            threatened, their protest sites ripped apart? What happened to the victims of the violence that erupted in North
            East Delhi, largely Muslims, many of whom find themselves being arrested and jailed for the very violence that
            destroyed their lives? What new forms will the peaceful protests against the unjust CAA-NRC-NPR look like? In
            fact, will we ever see them take over the streets again? Do the whitewashed walls of Shaheen Bagh still hold our
            collective rage, and the imagination of our democratic nation? At times like these, looking back and reminiscing
            seems like an almost indecent luxury. Nevertheless, reflect and write we must, for the raging powerful light of
            Shaheen Baghs have shown us the way for eons to come.

        <br><br>
        It was in August 2019, when the figure of ‘1.9 million people’ in Assam hit the headlines<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">2</sup>. Who are these people
        and what will happen to them was a question that stuck like a fishbone in the throat of the nation. The Supreme
        Court mandated and monitored exercise culminated in the publication of the National Register of Citizens <a style="font-weight:400; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.nrcassam.nic.in/index-M.html">(NRC)</a>
        in Assam, and a ‘mere’ 6% of 33 million people who had applied to establish their belonging, were deemed ‘illegal
        immigrants’. Never mind if you and your family lived in Assam for decades, even from pre-independence times.
        Just suck it up if you are on the list and the rest of your family not, so what if one odd sibling is not included.
        Shut-up. Just shut-up with your ranting and your prayers, if you were not organised and resourceful enough to
        have had your papers in order. And if you are who you say you are, especially a Hindu a ‘genuine Indian citizen’,
        who god-forbid-how, found yourself excluded, then the government will do many a somersault to challenge the
        NRC Coordinator, the process and the list, and attempt to use the CAA in order to bring you back into the fold<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">3</sup>.
        But if you are on the ‘wrong side’ of the current prevailing idea of community/religion/ethnicity, then buckle up
        to make your case to the Foreigners Tribunal, or risk being packed off to a detention centre<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">4</sup>

                While talk of the NRC project had been on since
                2015, this development in Assam was a test balloon
                to check the temperature, to increase the heat. How
                much is too much? After all, the abrogation of Article
                370 in Kashmir had just been carried out, and the
                applause of how smooth an operation it was could
                be heard all the way from the stage of ‘Howdy, Modi!’
                to the staged sights of foreign diplomats in the idyllic
                settings of the Dal lake<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">5</sup>.
                Then, not much was said of the
                criminalization of Muslim men with the passage of the
                Triple Talaq Bill, right?! And the judgment on the Babri
                Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, just forget about
                it. Don’t you know it’s now legally established that the
                land does not belong to ‘you’, it belongs to those, who,
                even the judgment says, wrongfully demolished it. Just
                get on with the programme.

        The least we can say about the BJP is that it’s a party
        which keeps its promises. One such promise made in
        its election manifesto was to bring about a ‘Citizenship
        Amendment Bill 2016’ (CAB). Soon after the BJP led
        government’s victory in the 2019 General Elections,
        the noise around the CAB grew much louder and as did
        the one for a nationwide NRC. Of course, the purported
        reason for the CAB was to fast-track citizenship for
        persecuted Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians
        and Parsis from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
        All ‘others’, especially Muslims, can wait their turn to
        be thrown out, if declared non-citizens. And others
        like trans* persons, adivasis, and countless others
        without adequate documents or any other way to
        prove their belonging, can wait and watch from the
        sidelines. Not to forget, that all this talk of protecting
        persecuted minorities came in the back drop of the
        Indian government deporting the persecuted Rohingya
        Muslims to Myanmar<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">6</sup>.
        <br><br>
        <i><div>
        “Pakistan’s Hindu community unanimously rejects
        this bill, which is tantamount to dividing India on
        communal lines,” said the Pakistan Hindu Council.
        <br><br>
        “We, the Christians of Pakistan, are not at all interested
        [in taking] refuge in India... Modi’s citizenship bill does
        not favour the minorities at all as it is discriminatory
        and against basic human rights.”<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">7</sup>

        There are genuine concerns and apprehensions in
        Bangladesh that the NRC and CAA might unleash an
        exodus of Bengali-speaking people from Assam and
        Muslims attempting to escape persecution in India.
        After having taken in nearly a million Rohingya
        refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar, Bangladesh
        cannot take in any more.<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">8</sup>
        </i>
        <br><br>
        In October 2019, when the country was in the grip of
        Dussehra-Diwali-Durgapuja-Amazon-Great-Diwali-Sale
        fever, and the fate of those 1.9 million was still unknown,
        Home Minister Amit Shah announced that the National
        Register of Citizens will be implemented in the entire
        country<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">9</sup>.
        Just days before this announcement, setting
        the stage, the Home Minister, speaking at an event
        celebrating the 26th foundation day of the National
        Human Rights Commission, had urged India, and the
        world, to view human rights violations in India with
        the ‘Indian outlook’. Further adding that, ‘under Prime
        Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, India is moving
        towards a scenario where there will be no human
        rights violations!’ (well, what to say about the NHRC<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">10</sup>).
        Concurrently, the government was also making steady
        headway in fulfilling its electoral promise of bringing
        about the Citizenship Amendment Bill.
        <br><br>
        But the government had a problem on their hands
        – the 1.9 million who fell out of the NRC web in
        Assam weren’t all muslims, who the intention had
        been to comb out. So during the winter session of
        the Parliament, amidst hue and cry from across the
        country, the Citizenship Amendment Act on 11 December 2019. The CAB was now CAA<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">11</sup> and the NRC was
        being discussed alongside the NPR. The National Population Register (NPR<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">12</sup>) is a ‘Register of usual residents
        of the country. The last National Population Register was collected in 2010 along with the house listing phase
        of Census of India 2011’, says the MHA website. These developments caused an incredible amount of confusion,
        panic and insecurity especially for the muslim minority in the country. How to prove one’s citizenry!<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">13</sup>
        <br><br>
        As people began scrambling for birth certificates and other documents, many also began to question the
        government, asking that it stop speaking in forked tongues. The ‘NRC will definitely be implemented all over the
        country, we are ready to roll it out at a cost of about Rs. 30,000 crores,’ said one tongue; while the other said,
        ‘you have nothing to fear, NRC isn’t here!’<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">14</sup> Frustrated at the stupid subjects asking stupid questions, the Home
        Minister finally said ‘Aap chronology samajhiye’, and you know, that’s exactly what we, the people, did.
        <br><br>
        <b>Things get darker.</b><br><br>
        Soon after CAA 2019 became the law of the land, many protests, dharnas, rallies, press conferences sprung
        up all over the country, and by the signs of it, the government wasn’t in a mood for any of that. After all, good,
        abiding citizens are just meant to buy (with our duly demonetised currency) every half-truth and full lie sold
        to us through parliamentary statements, sarkari slogans, ads, the godi media and every other weapon in the
        propaganda arsenal. But, the people, it seems, hadn’t got the script.
        <br><br>
        Not just in the ‘legally designated’ protest spaces like Jantar Mantar in Delhi, Azad Maidan in Bombay, Vidhan
        Soudha in Bangalore, but also in college campuses, residential areas, on streets and in marketplaces, across the
        country, voices against CAA-NRC-NPR started getting louder. Uff, what a nuisance the subjects are being! Time
        to crack down on, and stem the tide. And what better place to start than at a fairly routine protest within the
        campus of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University
        in Delhi.
        <br><br>
        <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; column-gap:14px; align-items: center;">
            <p style="flex: 1 1 300px; min-width: 240px; margin: 0;">
                Uninvited into the campus, the Delhi Police threw
                stones at the protestors inside the campus and then
                broke down the main gate, lathi charged the students,
                barged into the library and smashed furniture, light
                fixtures, and of course, student’s bodies, busting into
                women’s toilets to drag female students out by their
                hair, and oh yes, let’s not forget, threw firebombs
                into buses and then claimed they were just trying to
                quell the violence. (Phew! Just catching our breath). If
                you haven’t still seen the video, <a style="font-weight:400; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DP-VUPenZpPE"> here</a> it is. Maybe we
                should send it to the NHRC who’s recent ‘findings’ on
                the events echoes the voice of the central government
                and the Delhi Police, and says, ‘the students did it!’ At
                about the same time, the students of Aligarh Muslim
                University were holding a peaceful protest against
                the CAA. Again, the security forces indulged in lathi
                charge, firing of tear gas shells and rubber pellets at the
                protesting students for no valid reason on December
                15, 2019. Someone see a pattern here?

        <br>
        Just days after the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) was published in Assam, a people’s tribunal was
        organised in New Delhi to discuss issues related to citizenship, titled,
        <a style="font-weight:400; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank" href="https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-364231.pdf">
         People’s Tribunal on Contested Citizenship
        in Assam – Constitutional Processes and the Human Cost.</a>
        <br>
        Hearing the testimonies of those excluded from the final list of NRC and various leading experts, the jury comprising
        former SC judges Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice AP Shah and Professor
        Faizan Mustafa, Vice Chancellor, Nalsar University of Law, Hyderabad, former Planning Commission member Syeda
        Hamid, Ambassador Deb Mukherjee, Githa Hariharan of Indian Writers’ Forum and Professor Monirul Hussain,
        said, ‘We all agree that the NRC has spawned a humanitarian crisis. We worry because there are no signs of this
        crisis abating. Large numbers of minorities in Assam, whether religious, linguistic or ethnic, have lived with the
        fear of being told that they don’t belong in this country. They may, at any time, be marked doubtful voters (or
        D-Voter) and prevented from exercising their franchise. A local border police constable can, again, at any time,
        accuse them of being foreigners and refer their cases to a detention centre. Even after the final register, there
        are many demands for selective reverification.’

        </div>
        <br><br>
        Anyway, the parents of the young students who got thrashed did what parents and in fact, any decent people
        would do. Stepped out and said, ‘stop it! enough is enough’. Of course, the JMIs, JNUs, and other students groups,
        civil/democratic/women’s rights and other liberals did it, but it was a working class neighbourhood called
        Shaheen Bagh that stands along the banks of the Yamuna and on the Magenta line of the Delhi Metro, really
        ‘did it’. Hundreds of women, with their children tucked under the armpit, got out of their homes, and blocked
        the street in protest. We all know these women, they are same burqas clad women who the government had to
        ‘rescue’ by criminalising their triple-talaq-giving-husbands<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">15</sup>. Newsflash! They have a voice, an opinion, and an
        imagination. And amazingly, the capacity to change the course of history and protests in the country, irrespective
        of what has followed since.
        <br><br>
        The women of Shaheen Bagh, the dadis of Shaheen Bagh, the children of Shaheen Bagh occupied the main Kalindi
        Kunj road and started a peaceful sit-in with only one demand: ‘Take back CAA-NRC-NPR’. And soon, Shaheen Baghs
        were springing up all over the city – in Khureji Khas, Jama Masjid, Turkman Gate, Shahi Eidgah, Nizamuddin,
        Seelampur, Hauz Rani, Chand Bagh, Inderlok... 27 plus sites. And beyond Delhi there sprung, literally, hundreds
        of protests sites across Lucknow, Kolkata, Ranchi, Gaya, Kanpur, Hyderabad, Patna, Bangalore, Kolkata, Varanasi...
        in Europe, the US, Canada and so on.
        <br><br>
        As day became night, and nights blossomed into songs, slogans and chatter, these sites attracted to themselves
        many like us, battered and weary in our quest for ‘woh subah kabhi toh aayegi’. Spending whatever time we could
        with the women and students, soaking in the energy and doing our bit: talking to the women, volunteering at the
        medical counter, discovering new slogans, singing and performing, teaching and playing with the children at the
        Savitribai Phule and other libraries/ activity centres set up for the children at many of the sites, raising issues
        related to the CAA, religious and caste discrimination, the idea of the nation and much more.
        <br><br>
        The idea of the Shaheen Baghs was like an eternal spring – a fresh, sparkling source of untiring energy for a
        community which has been targeted by lynchings, harassment and systematic political exclusion over the past
        several years, and whose defence mechanism has largely been to invisibilize itself in public. But let’s be honest,
        they were much more than the voice of the community, they were the voice we all had been seeking in our so-called
        ‘intersectional politics.’ Young and old women, many of them illiterate, who were soon effortlessly drawing their
        strength and articulation from, and teaching us a lesson or two about, the Constitution, Babasaheb Ambedkar,
        Fatima Sheikh, Savitribai Phule, Bhagat Singh, Ashfaqulla Khan, Ram Prasad Bismil, and Gandhi. After a very, very
        long time of hate, divisive and destructive politics, we
        saw a glimmer of democracy re-imagined, citizenship
        owned and asserted in ways so creative that they
        will forever be etched in our minds. As we stood/sat
        together reading the Preamble in multiple languages
        at India Gate, with Radhika Vemula and Saira Bano on Republic
        Day, singing the national anthem on New Year’s Eve with a sense of belief in its possibilities!
        What a miracle that was/is.

                An image, an idea, that we have not seen evoked in
                movements since possibly the independence struggle,
                was the use of the
                Tricolour.
                The Flag was everywhere,

                held high.
                The
                National Anthem was sung daily at
                many sit-ins. As reading the Preamble became the
                norm at protests across the country, we the people,
                who believe, that we don’t need to wear our patriotism
                on our sleeve pivoted between cringing at this overt
                show of nationalism, and the awe we felt for those
                who reclaimed these symbols from the clutches of
                the right wing. Putting an end to any questions about
                their ‘Indian-ness’, perhaps. Making us think about our
                politics and privileges in completely new ways.

                Simultaneously, there were multiple protest events
                across the country.
                If so many hundreds of thousands
                marched to Azad Maidan in Mumbai, that the only way
                to see the whole crowd was from the top of a multi-
                storeyed building; coordinated national marches led by
                women, trans* and queer communities, students etc;
                and so many plays and skits and songs and verses and
                memes and online action... that all spoke to resisting the
                CAA-NRC-NPR package deal that is being thrust
                upon us. #Reject CAA #RejectNRC #Reject NPR
                <br>
                As the popularity of these protests grew, the
                international attention began to be a problem for the State and its fellows. The government (both Delhi and Central) refused to meet the protestors and engage
                with their demands, despite the most loving missives
                from the protestors.
                Instead, right wing groups
                repeatedly attempted to ‘ukhaad nikaalo’ the protests,
                the state arbitrarily withdrew permissions given for
                protests, blocked metro stations to prevent people
                from reaching rally and protest sites, picked people
                up from the sites and took them on a
                Dilli-darshan for
                hours to try to stop them from protesting.
                Of course,
                we the (problematic) citizens would turn around and
                rejoin the protesting masses the moment they let us off
                in some obscure corner of the city. And thank heavens
                we did, because those were days we could still protest
                on the streets, remember?

                But let’s face it, all the romance of the protests aside, things were getting a bit crazy. Take for example the trajectory of
                cases against these two 19 year olds: Ram Bhagat Gopal Sharma, shot at the protestors at JMI screaming ‘ye lo azaadi’,
                while the police stood around with folded arms and let a student get injured. Amulya Leona went onto the stage of
                an anti-CAA event in Bangalore organised by the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM ), and proclaimed
                ‘Long Live All Nations’... and among the nations she said ‘zindabad’ to was Pakistan. She was charged with sedition
                under the dreaded UAPA, while Sharma was out on bail within the week or so. Leona finally received bail only after
                spending 6 months in jail. Meanwhile, someone threw a petrol bomb at the protest site in Shaheen Bagh, the police
                did an unprovoked lathi charge at the Hauz Rani site, the story was turning...
                <br><br>
                In the midst of it, came the Delhi elections, marked by just one thing: talk of governance by the AAP party, and
                hate speech against the Muslim community by the BJP and its allies. Deeply shocked by this, Saheli, along with 175
                other feminist and human rights organisations and activists, issued an Open Letter to the Prime Minister on
                3 February 2020, saying, ‘Vote for BJP or you will get raped? Is this your message to Delhi’s women? Your party
                is also exhorting mobs to aim bullets at women & children... Fight the election upholding the dignity of our
                Constitution.’

        <b>It’s a night without end.</b>
        <br><br>
        It was February 2020, but it was reminiscent of 1984 Delhi and 2002 Gujarat, when many of us watched as horrific
        visuals unfolded on our television screens. Smoky skies and armed mobs running amok burning houses, shops,
        hurtling bricks as violence erupted in North East Delhi on 23 February, and continued for another few days. While
        NE Delhi was burning, a few kilometres away the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump was
        enjoying a lavish banquet hosted by the State.<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">16</sup> It was ‘Namaste Trump’ time, after all.
        <br><br>
        In the next few days, as more details emerged and bodies were found rotting in the drains of NE Delhi, the gravity of
        what had happened began to sink in. Of the 53 who lost their lives, two-thirds belonged to the Muslim community. As
        stories of mosques (14, according to one estimate<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">17</sup>) being set on fire, and the destruction of mainly Muslim owned
        businesses and properties started pouring in, it became clear that this was communally motivated. Several areas
        of NE Delhi were also sites of the anti-CAA women protests, and many believed that the peaceful protesters would
        not move until their one and only demand was met. Was this planned attacked a way of silencing them? Perhaps
        BJP’s Kapil Mishra, of the ‘desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro saalon ko’ fame, can throw some light on this<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">18</sup>? If you
        are an optimist, you may also ask, what was the police doing<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">19</sup>? According to many accounts, the police was present
        often as spectators to the violence around them. There are also accounts that claim that they actively participated. It
        seemed that they only moved into the area in large numbers a few days later, and that too after the Delhi High Court
        ordered them to assist move the injured to hospitals<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">20</sup>. The hospitals were no better.
        <br><br>
        A report titled, “The Role of Health Systems in
        Responding to Communal Violence” by the Jan Swasthya
        Abhiyan (JSA), speaks of the apathy with which victims
        of violence were treated at government hospitals,
        that is, if they managed to reach one because mobs
        continued to obstruct the movement of ambulances.
        At the hospitals themselves, there were several
        instances of patients not bring provided with adequate
        treatment, with one doctor even calling the victim a
        terrorist and extremist, and cruelly, bodies not being
        handed over to families for days on end.
        <br><br>
        In a letter to Delhi CM Kejriwal, the JSA elaborated,
        “We have also been made aware of instances where
        hospitals are denying admission to injured persons
        whose MLCs were done in a different hospital, without
        the MLC number and treatment records. Families and
        patients are thus being penalized and harassed for
        not producing documents which are being denied to
        them in the first place... Hospitals are not proactively
        supporting families of injured people... families are
        running from pillar to post to identify their missing
        relatives. Multiple individuals who have been victims of
        violence have reported instances of being subjected to
        discriminatory language by staff members at hospitals.
        A few people have even expressed fear of going to
        government hospitals, instead choosing to access
        critical care at local clinics.”
        <br><br>
        Meanwhile, the state, was spinning great tales of
        conspiracy aimed at shifting the blame on to the victims
        for the violence<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">21</sup> – a script being clearly followed in the
        spate of arrests of student and other activists from the
        anti CAA movement as being masterminds of a leftist-
        jihadi-radical (will someone please explain what kind
        of politics this is?) conspiracy<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">22</sup>!
        <br><br>
        In the weeks that followed, Eidgah-Mustafabad became
        a relief camp site where about 1200 people took
        shelter, people whose homes were burnt, livelihood
        destroyed, and those who were too fearful of going
        back. The camp, of course, had no proper tenting, no
        toilets and nothing for people to eat. Add to that the
        relentless rains that lashed Delhi those days, soaking
        the mattresses and robbing victims of even their sleep.
        <br><br>
        Several citizen initiatives sprang up in response to
        these terrible events: to offer rescue and refuge to
        victims; to offer medical aid and relief support; to
        remind government officials, agencies, bodies of their
        constitutional duty to protect all citizens; to reach
        out with food, clothing, sanitary products, rations and
        other essentials; to counsel and help the old and the
        young and the children in this time of trauma; to offer
        immediate aid to those disabled or paralyzed due to
        injuries. Peace committees were formed to reach out to
        at the neighbourhood level. Called ‘Aman ki Aawazein’,
        we went from one locality to another with messages
        of peace, justice, harmony and togetherness. A meal
        here, a song there, a poem read, a sharing of information of rights guaranteed by the
        courts... all sharing a moment in solidarity in times of duress.

            – two of his autorickshaws which he proudly pointed out say ‘Jai Mata Di’ on the back, were burnt because in one of them
            he was ferrying Muslim passengers and the mob probably thought he was Muslim too. “I am a Hindu!” he kept saying.’
            <br><br>
            ‘In Mustafabad people were angry and said the central government was busy with the Trump visit instead of ensuring
            early deployment of army or police, which would have saved lives and protected their properties. Even after the attack,
            no one from the state or central government has reached out to victims. And it has been nearly 4 days now, to the first
            attack on Sunday (Feb 23). There was NO relief effort. No food, no places for the displaced to stay, no one to call. At
            Chand Bagh, we were asked if we could arrange food for 200 families of labourers being accommodated in a masjid.’

        </div>
        <br><br>
        Even as the Covid-19 crisis became a global pandemic, the central government refused to
        take back its order to start updation of the NPR along with house listing for the Census
        2021 from 1 April, 2020. So more than 1000 women from across 20 states of India,
        wrote to every state Chief Minister in the country saying, “NPR presents a clear danger
        to women, so we demand de-linking of NPR from census house listing.” Addressing a
        crowded press conference in Delhi, women rights activists, including Annie Raja, Farah
        Naqvi, Anjali Bhardwaj, Vani Subramanian, Meera Sanghamitra, Mariam Dhawle and
        Poonam Kaushik said, “Women constitute nearly 50% of India’s population, and all
        women, irrespective of caste and religious community will be affected by this regime that
        puts our citizenship to test in a totally arbitrary and frightening manner.” At the same time, the activists
        welcomes the fact that Kerala and West bengal had already issued stay orders on the roll out of the NPR.
        <br><br>
        And what was the central government doing meanwhile? Within days of Lockdown 1.0 the relief camp was shut
        and people were left to fend for themselves. All the protest sites, including Shaheen Bagh, were removed, and the
        vibrant anti CAA-NRC-NPR graffiti white washed (literally)<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">23</sup>. But that’s all they can do... kyunki ‘hum dekhenge’
        (Faiz must be pleased<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">24</sup>), and also because ‘hum kaagaz nahi dikhayenge’ by Varun Grover, the two popular
        anthems of this movement. The peaceful protests ended, many of us argued that given the situation it was perhaps
        wise to do so. However, what stays alive is the vision that imagines this country as one belonging to everyone.
        <br><br>
        The Covid-19 health crisis has rapidly become an economic crisis, an employment crisis and a migrant crisis –
        exposing all faultlines and fissures. No amount of thali clanging, diya lighting, made-up economic packages will
        undo what has been witnessed, what is being lived through. But even at this time, the anti-Muslim sentiment runs
        deep as was illustrated by calls to boycott Muslim-owned businesses<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">25</sup>, and the targeting of the members of the
        Tablighi Jamaat who were held responsible for the pandemic because of an international summit they held in early
        March. The nation communalized a virus<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">26</sup>. As our focus shifted to providing relief to, too many to count, Covid-19
        impacted communities: daily wagers, victims of violence in NE Delhi, migrants on the move, sex workers, trans*
        persons and so on, the State’s focus shifted to targeting anti-CAA protestors. (Joint statement by feminists follows.).
        <br><br>
        Maybe, this time, the light will break through.
        What happens next? Who knows. But it seems that the chasm between the haves, the ones who belong, whose
        citizenry is guaranteed; and all the rest, has become a painful putrid gash. This hurt was for all to see in the plight
        of migrant workers during lockdown. Thrown out of work, walking endlessly on foot, dying of hunger, dragging
        along their measly belongings and their broken hearts.
        <br><br>
        A lot is to be said about what the government did and didn’t during this crisis, but that’s a piece for another time. The
        SC intervened only in early June providing some relief, however belated, to the migrant workers<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">27</sup>. But can we unsee
        the gut wrenching video of that dead migrant and her child on a train platform in Bihar, the incident in Aurangabad
        where exhausted workers, sleeping on a train track were crushed to death<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">28</sup>. There are too many to count...
        <br><br>
        Betrayed by the glittering cities, by the courts and the governments. Maybe the migrant workers will never come
        back to polish and shine our lives, to make our cars, serve us at restaurants, to wait endlessly at labour chowks for
        our largesse, to care for our children ‘just like their own’... or maybe the companies who didn’t have the resources
        to give them their salaries at a time of crisis will suddenly find the funds to charter planes to get them back!<sup style="font-size: 10px; font-weight: 500;">29</sup>

        <b>CONDEMNING CRACKDOWN ON WOMEN ACTIVISTS IN DELHI</b><br><br>
        <b>1,100+ FEMINISTS ACROSS RELIGION, CLASS, CASTE, ETHNICITY,<br>
        ABILITY, SEXUALITY AND GENDERS ISSUE SOLIDARITY STATEMENT</b><br>
        <br><b>DENOUNCE</b> false narratives that try to link anti-CAA protests with the violence in Delhi.
        <br><b>DEMAND</b> an immediate stop to targeting of Muslim women activists
        under the shadow of the Covid 19 lockdown.
        <br><b>SEEK ACTION</b> against actual perpetrators of violence, not peaceful protestors.
        <br><b>STAND FIRM</b> with the conscience keepers of the nation
        <br><br>
        3 May, 2020: We, the undersigned, strongly condemn the brazenly malicious attacks, arrests and intimidation by
        the Delhi Police of Muslim women, students and activists, as well as other citizens who have spoken up against the
        unconstitutional moves of the present ruling dispensation. Media reports that about 800 + anti-CAA protesters have
        been detained or arrested since the Covid 19 lockdown, which means they have had little or no access to lawyers and
        legal aid, and their families given no information of their whereabouts for extended periods after they were in custody.
        The impunity with which the Delhi Police is carrying out this sweep under direct orders from the Home Ministry is
        facilitated by the reduced media, public and legal scrutiny under the lockdown. As feminists, we decry this systematic
        crackdown on, and mis-representation of, the peaceful and constitutional anti-CAA-NRC-NPR movement. Led so
        powerfully by Muslim women across the country, these protests witnessed a new wave of women stepping out in their
        own neighbourhoods in huge numbers, defying social structures and asserting their rights as citizens of a secular,
        democratic republic—one of the most historic moments and movements, since independence. In Delhi itself, from the
        Dadis of Shaheen Bagh to the spirited women from Jamia, Hauz Rani, Jama Masjid, Nizamuddin, Seelampur, etc, the
        women’s spectacular leadership and the solidarities they formed across communities and locations inspired millions
        across the world, but evidently, also shook the foundations of the ruling elite. After all, until these women organised
        themselves with such clarity, and commitment to democratic values, the only use the government had for them was
        as symbols of repression to be ‘saved’ from Muslim customary practices such as the Triple Talaq.
        <br><br>
        GULFISHA, 25, is one such young muslim woman who emerged a leader in the Seelampur anti-CAA protest. An MBA
        student, Gulfisha has reportedly been arrested by the police on 9th April, but until this day, the details remain blurry.
        She has been languishing in judicial custody under false charges of sedition, without proper access to her family or
        lawyer. The Covid lockdown has brought jail mulakats to a standstill, and no alternative means of communication such
        as telephonic contact are available to be apprised of her state of health or well-being. The same holds for numerous
        men from Seelampur who were allegedly picked up by the police at about the same time as Gulfisha, although their
        exact whereabouts are not known. SAFOORA ZARGAR, 30, member of the Jamia Coordination Committee has been
        arrested despite being three months’ pregnant—at a time when overcrowding in prisons and have become a huge
        concern worldwide. Former Municipal Councillor, ISHRAT JAHAN, active in the Khureji protest has been in jail for over
        a month now, and been subjected to custodial torture. Her co-accused, Khalid Saifi emerged from police custody with
        both his legs as well as two fingers broken—indicating brutal torture. We have good reason to fear for the rights and
        safety of Gulfisha, Safoora, Ishrat and others like them: as women, as undertrial prisoners, and as those falsely charged
        under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).
        <br><br>
        Some of the other student activists arrested and slapped with draconian charges and sent to judicial custody include
        Meeran Haider (President, RJD Youth Wing, Delhi), Sharjeel Imam (JNU scholar), Shifa-Ur-Rehman (President, Jamia
        Alumni Association). Dr. Umar Khalid of United Against Hate has also been reportedly slapped with UAPA and is ‘under
        investigation’. In an unprecedented and shameless move, the Delhi Police has now even booked Zafarul Islam Khan,
        Chairman, Delhi Minorities Commission under sedition charges! We must remember that inspired by Shaheen Bagh, sit-in
        protests led by Muslim women were held in 200+ locations across the country. Holding up images of Savitri Bai, Fatima
        Sheikh, Babasaheb Ambedkar, painting protest graffiti and reading the Preamble, reciting poetry and slogans upholding
        constitutional values and communal harmony, this was a tremendously powerful assertion of rights and resistance, of
        historically marginalized women creating the possibility of a new nation of emancipation, justice, equality and dignity. In
        response, the majoritarian forces of the Hindu right, shifted the register of contestation by unleashing multiple attacks
        on these gatherings, culminating in a pre-planned communal pogrom targeting the Muslims in North-East Delhi.
        <br><br>
        The government, unwilling to dialogue with the women, chose the masculinist response of trying to crush them. Its
        message is clear—those who dare challenge its fascist, patriarchal, communal, classist and casteist nature will be meted
        the harshest State sanctions. Countless detentions, interrogation and intimidation of women and student activists
        from many anti-CAA protest sites and universities like Jamia, bear testimony to how
        brazenly the State is using everything, including the pandemic, to silence more than
        just one Gulfisha or Safoora; to warn all Muslim women who dare to speak out. For
        minority communities to exist in India today seems to be a provocation, for them to
        question and think seems to be a greater trouble, and of course, to protest and sing
        songs of azaadi is apparently just too much.
        <br><br>
        Not surprisingly, a malicious and false narrative that ‘the peaceful protests by women
        were the cause of the violence in Delhi’ has been propagated by the police, fanned by
        sections of the media and vested interests to camouflage the explicit political nature of
        the violence, carried out with the collusion and participation of security forces. Despite
        claims by the police of ‘finding the real culprits’, the organized and premeditated nature
        of the violence on the minority community and the great asymmetry in losses and
        deaths between affected communities is yet to be accounted for. Right-wing leaders of
        the BJP such as Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur who openly threatened violence have not even been named in FIRs.
        Those who fired at gatherings are out on bail. Reports of ‘out-of-towners’ brought in to perpetuate the violence have
        yet to be subjects of investigation.
        <br><br>
        After all of this, the community which bore the brunt of the communal violence most, including the peaceful women
        protesters and men, is being projected as the ‘aggressor’ and demeaned in numerous ways through vicious propaganda.
        Hundreds of Muslims are being picked up and incarcerated. There is no clarity on the total number of FIRs, arrests
        and detentions. Muslim women and other activists who worked with them in solidarity towards a shared concept of
        citizenship and feminist sisterhood are also being systematically vilified. Media reports that in the last some days, the
        police has seized the phones of AISA activist Kawalpreet Kaur and few activists of Pinjra Tod. Worrying accounts of
        women students who were active in the peaceful protests, being targeted are also coming to the fore. Taking cognizance
        of such ground realities, the Delhi High Court as recently as on 27th April, directed the Delhi Police to comply with the
        DK Basu guidelines regarding arrests and detentions.
        <br><br>
        In the long run, these attacks by the State will affect far more than members of just one community. Much like the NRC
        project that is bound to deprive the poor and marginalized across religious groups of citizenship rights, the present
        focus on terrorizing Muslims instead of tackling the Covid-19 pandemic reveals a deep apathy towards safeguarding the
        lives and well-being of millions of toiling poor across the country, many of whom belong to the ‘majority’ community.
        <br><br>
        We remember with hope and inspiration the vibrant anti-CAA protests across the country from December to February.
        We remember that while the State was firing tear gas shells in libraries and mercilessly lathi-charging peaceful protesters
        and students, while the police stood by as vigilante gunmen opened fire, these protesters stood strong and fearless in
        their determination against the Hindutva project. They are the conscience keepers of the nation, and we salute them!
        The actions of the State only reveal how much it fears such voices, and how far it will go to subvert the cause of truth
        and justice. We declare our unflinching solidarity with the Muslim women, students and activists who worked together
        as harbingers of peace and shall defeat sinister attempts to project them in bad light by the state and vested interests.
        <br><br>
        <b>WE DEMAND:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Delhi Police must immediately make public all FIRs, arrests and detentions with their legal status and conduct a free and fair investigation into all the incidents of violence.</li>
            <li>False cases against peaceful anti-CAA protesters must be dropped, and all those arrested on trumped-up charges must be released immediately.</li>
            <li>Real culprits of the violence in Delhi must be booked, including the likes of Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and others who instigated hate, sparked and perpetuated the violence.</li>
            <li>Detentions, intimidation & harassment of those who assert the democratic right to protest must stop.</li>
            <li>Prisons must be de-congested as per orders of the Apex Court and all political prisoners released.</li>
            <li>UAPA and the Sedition law must be repealed.</li>
        </ul><br><br>

        <br>
        Saheli has had a challenging journey, and what better occasion than completing 25 years, to review and analyse our struggles in order to build on the strengths to move forward with renewed vigour.
        <br><br>
        We wanted to look at the experiences of a range of autonomous movements, and their experiences of being non-party and non-funded. These include – democratic rights movement, tribal/forest rights movements, Dalit movement, sexuality rights movement, autonomous rural women’s union (Sathins). The presentations explored the challenges faced; the limitations and as well as strengths of autonomous politics; experiences of allying with other like-minded movements, and the articulation of autonomous politics in these alliances and broad formations; experiences of mainstream electoral politics for autonomous mass organisations.
        <br><br>
        The presentations individually explored the articulation of women’s rights in these movements (for instance-Sathin union – women’s labour, forest movement – women’s rights over natural resources etc.), and examined whether these articulations had been shaped by autonomous politics. Most significantly, all presentations touched upon the relevance of autonomous politics in today’s political context.
        <br><br>
        So we had Uma Chakravarti, Delhi, speaking on the democratic rights’ movement; Chayanika Shah, Forum Against Oppression of Women and Labia, Mumbai, on the queer movement; Saraswathi on organising Dalit women workers in Karnataka; Shamim, Shramik Adivasi Sanghathan, M.P, on mass organising and political mobilisation and Kiran Dubey on the Sathin Union, Rajasthan.
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">UMA CHAKRAVARTI, DELHI, ON THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS’ MOVEMENT</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Uma</b>: As one of the older ones - am going to be 65-the history that I carry is perhaps out of the framework for many of you here. In the morning someone pointed out that she was younger than Saheli! I have a double location in the feminist movement. My politicisation and personal journey were both shaped in Miranda House College, where being a committed college teacher meant getting involved with issues around you. In the 1960s, the post-independence nation-state was in a crisis and the system was shaken by the Naxalite movement which raised issues of land rights and economic issues. More crises joined it – student movement in Bihar in the 1970s, and the Bodh Gaya movement.
        <br><br>
        To control all this upheaval, the Emergency was imposed. It was a traumatic moment in history, and the crisis was in the middle class. For instance, 200 teachers from Delhi University were jailed for being dissenters against Mrs Indira Gandhi and the party in power. Even the right to life was not conceded during the Emergency, but this was later challenged in court. When in 1977 the Emergency was lifted and elections announced, the most dramatic phenomenon was the emergence of civil society groups and civil rights groups. A huge meeting was held in 35 Ferozeshah Road. Sudesh (Vaid) of PUDR was one of the organisers. Sumanto (Banerjee) was there too. Groups like Peoples Union for Civil Liberties and Democratic Rights (PUCL and DR) came up as autonomous groups. Not branches of political parties, and they were forums for all kinds of people to come together.
        <br><br>
        Women’s groups broke away from political parties. Women also went to jail at that time, but we never thought that they experienced jail as women. In my personal archives I just found Snehlata Reddy’s prison diary, containing a daily account of her imprisonment. She was having a nervous breakdown in jail. It was clear that she was experiencing jail life as a woman. She also talks about the imprisonment of sex workers etc. After she came out, she got involved in prison reform.
        <br><br>
        In 1977-80, civil rights groups were powerfully located because it wasn’t sure in which direction the political situation was headed. The reports that came out were all about attacks of state repression, police atrocities etc. At the time of Rameeza Bi’s rape, women’s groups and democratic rights groups were functioning closely together. Women’s groups started with custodial violence, but moved into looking at violence in the personal sphere. The range of violence is increasing but we are stuck at an earlier understanding. Autonomous politics is sort of a division of labour, and some of us have feet in both camps. We don’t want to make hierarchies of oppression or gradations of exploitation. But we are forced into decisions – where we are divided into groups which take up specific issues.
        <br><br>
        Transformatory movements of cutting edge come from people from the double location - women like Sudesh (Vaid), for whom her primary identity was PUDR. But because of her, the old notion of democratic rights was challenged: you cannot look at democratic rights without looking at the violence and oppression that women face within the family. So ‘Inside the Family’ – a fantastic document, was an attempt to understand dowry violence. It is a formidable conceptualisation of the family, and came about after pushing the civil rights groups who were not taking this up on their own. Similarly, ‘Sadda Haq’, the report on widows. To this day, the job of holding up the mirror is coming from women in the Democratic Rights movement. But the frame has not shifted. Are we able to expand it to incorporate it with all contradictions? Women’s groups and democratic rights groups have fraternal relations and play complementary roles. There’s no problem in separateness, as long as we recognise that conceptually, there shouldn’t be a hierarchy of oppression. If we take the structure, we might see class, then caste, but patriarchy not that clearly. It is still assumed that patriarchy will vanish with the destruction of feudalism. But it will not. Patriarchy is as strong as class or caste.
        <br><br>
        Mindsets will not change unless there is structural change. Yet, hierarchies of oppression are created. For instance, sexuality – there is resistance to bring it into the framework. Autonomy should also mean autonomy to think outside the settled framework. That is the challenge before us. Both sets of groups need to conceptualise afresh so that all structures of oppression can be brought in, and that would help us to strategise better.
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">CHAYANIKA SHAH, FORUM AGAINST OPPRESSION OF WOMEN AND LABIA, MUMBAI, ON THE QUEER MOVEMENT</b>
        <br><br>
        We need to talk about the history of Stree Sangam/LABIA since not many people know. In the 1990s, some people had started talking about their sexuality. In some conferences, these issues had come up to some extent. Within the women’s movement, sexuality, lesbianism had come up at a discussion and theoretical level. These are important discussions. But about living as a lesbian, there was very little talk even within the women’s movement. In Forum’s 10 year booklet we listed the issues we didn’t talk about – one was lesbianism. Even in our personal lives and even in the movement, the perspective came later. Often, even in personal life, the realisation of ‘who am I?’ comes very late, because one hardly ever thinks about who one is. To recognise that there were other women like us is how Stree Sangam started. It was not seen as a political organisation, but a space for dialogue between lesbian and bisexual women. Of course, some people from the movement and Forum Against Oppression of Women (FAOW) were part of it.
        <br><br>
        After 1975-80, women’s oppression has been an identified oppression, and it was given a political perspective. But here, we began from a space where women were scared of themselves and their needs. But they were clear that their needs were different. There was a long time when there was a struggle between making it a social or political space. There is a lack of support from society and family, so there is an acute need for social space. The notion that women experiencing domestic violence would join the movement and join us in the process for change, failed. Because the onus of radicalism on the most marginalised does not work. Similarly, why expect that women, simply because they were lesbian, would be political? In fact, being marginalised, just living one’s life the way one wants is very difficult – it is a struggle in itself. We saw this in the women’s movement, and even with our group it was evident that every lesbian did not necessarily want to transform it into a political group.
        <br><br>
        It has been a unique journey over the past few years. The difficulty in getting other women’s groups to talk about it, and creating spaces has been a struggle. So it is good to have spaces like this one, where one can say that one is working with dalit, adivasi women, or lesbian women in the same breath. That space too has not come overnight - it has come through knocking by women from within, from outside, and also thinking through by the groups themselves.
        <br><br>
        Talking about autonomy - the group was autonomous because initially, no one wanted to be associated with it! So we automatically were autonomous. Slowly, a helpline started. Campaign groups like Caleri started, gay formations started. Around 2002, women who were with Stree Sangam in a political way felt they couldn’t run a social space. So then LABIA – Lesbians and Bisexuals in Action came up – clearly saying what we are about. In your face, no shying away. We are a feminist queer group. It’s difficult to translate queer in Hindi. There is no one word – only a paragraph! But it means a diverse range of sexuality. We like to call ourselves ‘Humjinsi’, not ‘samlaingik’. The structure of heteronormativity and compulsory heterosexuality – whoever questions it or breaks it is queer.
        <br><br>
        We fight both patriarchy and heteronormativity. Through the lesbian women’s movement, there are questions for the women’s movement. If women’s groups run a helpline, then issues of lesbian women should be part of the agenda. We are called to speak on sexuality, because we have a good understanding of the structures of sexuality and can critique it. But being queer, we might have something different to say about other aspects of the structure (not only about sexuality). But that is not as well recognised. When groups organise with a particular identity (like Muslim women), it becomes easy to simply ask Muslim women what they think, and go along with that, and sideline our own responsibility to think about Muslim women’s issues. The good thing is that we don’t want to speak on behalf of anyone. But the bad thing is that we are ghettoising them. A similar thing is happening with lesbian women.
        <br><br>
        There are instances from all over the country of wanting to marry/not wanting to marry, how to live together. Concept of ‘one true love’, problems of gender behaviour within these couples etc. ­issues we are not looking at. We are told marriage is such a patriarchal institution. We feel till it is an institution/model available to everyone, we want it too. It has to be available to all. We say - say ‘no’ to marriage for all, then we say no to marriage for lesbian women. When this is the only model available and women want it, what do we do? The queer movement, and women’s movement, are not taking up this issue? We need to look at families differently, new structures of living.
        <br><br>
        LABIA has taken a conscious decision to be autonomous, non-funded. We keep all other funded groups working on sexuality on their toes. There is a lot of funding coming in for sexuality – HIV/AIDS etc. But to what extent is this work questioning the structures of heteronormativity? What are the limitations put by funders? Nowadays, nobody takes a position that there should not be funding. There is a need to have funded groups. But then what is the role of groups like ours? Being what we are – loose structure…young people...with very little time except to live their lives, do their jobs, and to do this work along with that is very difficult. We have a small voice, we know, but even then we want to stay autonomous and make our voices heard. We play an important role in the women’s movement as well as the queer movement. The challenge is how to maintain that?

        "I am nervous about talking in English and Hindi, so I will sing now to ease my tension. This Kannada song is by a famous Dalit poet, and I am very proud to be singing this song. It is about letting our silences speak. It’s called ‘Hejje Maatadu’, written by the Dalit poet Ramaiyya."

        <br><br>

        Rather than a ‘speaker’, I am here as a friend who has come from Bangalore to share. I want to talk about two incidents. When in 5th standard, a story was told in my class about Gandhiji, who spun his own yarn. I was very moved, and on going home, began stitching my shoe, but got a beating from my father. I wondered why my father was hitting me, when I was doing a great thing like Gandhi. And the second was when I joined the powrakarmikas (municipal cleaners) – there was a strong resistance from my father. These two answers came to me at the age of 42, that my father also came from the same community – that picks up dead animals, cleans them and makes chappals. It is like a curse – to hide one’s origins.
        <br><br>
        I have two identities – one as a woman and one as a Dalit from the Madiga caste, which is one of the lowest untouchable castes. Within the Dalit movement, I was always asked why I interacted with non-Dalit, upper-caste, short-haired, English-speaking women in the feminist movement. And when I came to these women I was told that apart from caste there were other issues to be raised and talked about also, like patriarchy. I have solidarity with various movements. Otherwise, there is a huge wall between Dalits and non-Dalits.
        <br><br>
        After I left my bank job, I joined the powrakarmikas. For me, as a Dalit, the entry to work with powrakarmikas was relatively easy. I joined the sweepers’ union with all my autonomous politics and energy, all my resources. No funding, no political affiliations. But I did not have much clarity about my own role. I just wanted to do something, but not sure what and how. But I knew that the trade union movement of Dalits was very important. They were denied basic rights. Worked in very bad conditions – no gloves, no gumboots. There are more than 10,000 cleaners, who work like donkeys without any facilities from 7 am till 2 in the afternoon. The so called civilised people don’t even give them water to drink. More than 80% of the workers were women of my community. Class, gender, caste – made it very important to work there.
        <br><br>
        There were issues about (1) part time and full time activists, and raising money for them (2) collective democratic leadership, particularly that of women was very difficult and (3) lack of moral and emotional support. If I have emotional support, I can work like a donkey. But without it, can’t work. Got a lot of support from Manasa. I worked, but I had no official position. Therefore in decision-making, I found participation problematic. (4) Dealing with male ego was terrible, especially trade unionists with 40 years experience! It is very difficult to get women into collective decision-making. So it was very difficult for me to participate and justify my involvement in both Dalit and women’s movement.
        <br><br>
        The positive bit was being part of these movements. We started a support group, in which there were autonomous, non-funded groups, and they supported our movement (of powrakarmikas). In the morning, it was said that funding is justified for salaries of grassroots women. But I come from Karnataka where the movement of Dalits was started by penniless Dalits. What were their assets? The anger in their bellies, the songs in their hearts and their art – they are fantastic drummers. We can question what stage has it reached etc. – but that is a separate issue. The Dalit movement was autonomous unto the 80s and even 90s. And it was very gender sensitive.
        <br><br>
        And the women’s groups of 1970s and 1980s were also sensitive to Dalit issues. But I also feel that the women’s movement has not used the wit, the strength and potential of the Dalit women very well. Also it has not understood the different ways in which patriarchy and sexuality issues operate in Dalit communities. The feminist movement has been very important to me and autonomous politics is very precious. It has helped me to understand human contradictions and human complexities. When we talk of democracy and equality or collectivity and we collect even one rupee for work, that is very important. For me, activism is very spiritual. Spirituality minus gods and goddesses and religions. Gods in my community are not up there. Gods are talked to, shouted at, fed, cajoled. I need gods like that!
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">SHAMIM, SHRAMIK ADIVASI SANGHATHAN, MADHYA PRADESH, ON MASS ORGANISING AND POLITICAL MOBILISATION</b>
        <br><br>
        <img src="${r2FetchArticleImgURL}Article1/2.png" style="width: 100%; display: block; padding-top: 5px;" />
        <br><br>
        I first started working in MP in Bargi – the site of the first dam on the Narmada river. I met Anurag, and we got married and moved to Betul district to work with adivasis, mostly Korkus and Gonds. We have spread now to Harda and Khandwa. There is a lot of injustice and oppression. We went to this area precisely because we did not want to work with any established organisation with a hierarchy. We wanted to work in our own way.
        <br><br>
        When we started working people said we would be playing vote-bank politics. So we promised we won’t. We also had a middle class aversion to elections. We wanted to keep away from ‘dirty’ electoral politics because we were ‘good’ people. That was our first mistake. But now we feel that in a democracy one cannot bring about change without becoming a part of electoral politics. We did not want to be ‘tainted’ by politics, but at the same time realised that the people we were working with, were ending up bringing the same corrupt people to power. We were in this dilemma for four years. We simply could not join any of the established parties who used the marginalised people for their own vested interests, and played communal politics. We wanted a society without inequality of any kind – between rural and urban, educated and uneducated, adivasis, Dalits, women.
        <br><br>
        We decided to forge a new path, and decided to make our own party – Samajwadi Jan Parishad. We have branches in 14 states and are working with marginalised people and adivasis. We have been working for 14 years. For the first three years, no one supported us. We were often called Naxalites and thrown into jail. And then we realised that our energies are getting frittered away and we must channelise them and become part of the most effective medium – electoral politics. If you believe in democracy, then this is the only system available today, and one must utilise it, and imbue it with your own progressive values. To get out of the swamp of current electoral politics with all its murkiness, evolve a new political culture and build a new revolutionary electoral politics, that is the challenge.
        <br><br>
        Of course, it’s not easy. Everyone (all parties, bureaucracy, media) are out to malign the activists, especially the women. If you take a rally to the Collector and get your demands met, then the media says you are having an affair with the Collector. If you get imprisoned, then you are a Naxalite. There is no third option. I am supposed to have had an affair with every SP and Collector in the district! We stood in Harda, for MLA, against a whole bunch of goondas and mafia. But I feel that it has made us more powerful in many ways. Also, we are non-funded. So fighting an election was not easy. But we feel that it was very important that we even fought an election. Because it posed an alternative in front of people. It is even more important than winning. This we did despite the fact that bigger parties used goons to harass our activists, beat them up, got our jeep impounded, put us in jail. But in many such cases people sympathised and empathised with us, as honest people. When we were arrested, some women in a basti, who had never earlier supported us, refused to eat food that night.
        <br><br>
        We had started knowing we will win after a long time and we were ready to lose in preparation for that victory. There are five aspects: organisation building; agitation/protest; ideological change - in mindsets and perspectives; mass movement and political mobilisation: electoral politics. With globalisation and money becoming available and all important, our strategy has to be multi-pronged. Politics means we have to think of alternatives for everything and everyone. We have to work on our own funding, and that is going to be our strength. Only then will the embers be fanned and flames rise. Thank you, Zindabad.

        <b style="font-weight: 700;">KIRAN DUBEY ON THE SATHIN UNION, RAJASTHAN</b>
        <br><br>
        Since morning, I have seen the people who have laid the foundation of this organisation. A pillar that has given us strength from time to time. On behalf of the Sathins of Rajasthan, I congratulate Saheli. I am also thankful for the opportunity to share the struggle of the Sathins on this historic day.
        <br><br>
        Here, the focus will be more on the union process. This union is an independent trade union of the Sathin workers of the Women’s Development Programme (WDP), Rajasthan. The agenda of the union addresses workers rights, as well as women’s rights, and other women’s issues.
        <br><br>
        Through the WDP, women were activated and their participation at the grass roots increased. Women began breaking out of the shackles of traditional bondage and raised issues that had till now been socially prohibited. They took part in the jati (caste) panchayat; protested against domestic and other forms of violence; demanded property and other rights etc. Information was shared with the village women, about government schemes related to health, education, public distribution, etc. as well as the rules about wages and measurements in famine works; minimum wages; land records; property and other legal rights etc. As women’s power at the grassroots found an identity and the issues being raised started affecting the existing power equation, department started to exercise control.
        <br><br>
        There was growing discontent. The Sathin grew increasingly aware of the exploitative nature of her employment and the blatant inequalities in the salary structure within the hierarchy of WDP. Added to this, the Sathins experienced the true nature of the state, by witnessing the response to some specific situations. Some Sathins and village women of Kekri panchayat, had participated in the National Women’s Conference at Calicut in December 1990, under an independent banner. This was not tolerated by the department, and punitive action was taken and their jobs terminated on their return. They however continued their struggle for justice and fought a legal battle right up to the Supreme Court.
        <br><br>
        The class character of WDP became clearer and there were tensions between the functionaries at the different levels of the programme. Contradictions of the programme had surfaced forcing a split in the movement. Those in positions of power now sided with the government and the Sathins sided with the village women. The Sathins had support from a very small section of the women’s movement.
        <br><br>
        The irony was, that a programme initiated to empower rural women, not only failed to give recognition to the contribution of those very women, but it was on the contrary exploiting Sathins’ labour. In early 1990 the Sathins went on strike in the Sathin mela at Padmpura, and they placed a demand for an increase in the honorarium before the chief minister. Initial discussions and some initiative for unionising also took place in Bhilwara. Follwing a strike, the CM was forced to increase the honorarium by Rs 50. This was a turning point for the union process – and greatly strengthened the Sathins.
        <br><br>
        There was stiff opposition from the government, as well as from a very large segment of the women’s organisations and the NGO sector within the state. Because they felt that the anganwadi union gave minimal attention to women’s issues, the Sathins decided a separate union would be a better option to that of joining the existing ones. Theirs was an attempt to widen the trade union agenda with a focus on workers’ rights, to now also include the issues and concerns of the rural women. Finally, the union was registered in Ajmer.
        <br><br>
        The WDP occupied a central place within the women’s movement in Rajasthan. It had a dual ownership shared between the movement and the state. This sometimes led to a possessive attachment to the programme, on the part of the movement, and is perhaps an explanation for the strongly emotional reaction to some conflict situations. The hierarchical inequities within the structure were blurred through processes of collective functioning and through the projection of a united front. It was paradoxical that women from within the women’s movement when they were in situations of authority and control justified exploitative structures which grossly undervalued women’s work and contribution.
        <br><br>
        The strong opposition from representatives of the women’s movement within the programme to the Sathins decision to unionise needs to be looked at in the light of the above. The Sathins were accused of undermining the spirit of the programme: of moving away from the spirit of ‘sewa’ and community service, to one of focusing on their own selfish interests. They were also accused of splitting the movement; of indulging in ‘netagiri’; breaching mutual trust and so on. The Sathin union began to be viewed as a threat not only because it widened the notion of empowerment, but also by having a spill over effect involving the vast category of the voluntary worker.
        <br><br>
        The registration of the Sathin union in January 1993 was followed by efforts to spread the union to all the districts, a process met with a lot of opposition. The action plan of the union included the framing of the charter of demands and working out strategies to get the demands met by the government.
        <br><br> 
        The first annual state level convention of the union was held in May 1993 against strong resistance from the government. The denial of their basic rights as workers within WDP and the anti women policies of the state were recognised by the Sathins and articulated as core issues that needed to be addressed. The slogans reflected the thrust. For example: “Maan aur adhikaar chahiye, Kaam ka pura daam chahiye” (a demand for rights, respect and a just wage); <i>“Karamchari ka dharja do, sewa ke liya suraksha do”</i> ( a demand for status and security).     
        <br><br>
        The Sathin union received its first jolt from the government in January 1995, when it was decided to retrench the existing Sathins and recruit new ones in different gram panchayats; to limit the tenure of appointment of the new Sathins to five years and to fix an age limit for the Sathins. The Sathins replied in song: Atal Bihari Vajpayee – an old man running the country, and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, an old man running Rajasthan. So why not retrench them first?!
        <br><br>
        The Sathins demanded to know: Did the government now expect us to empower rural women (who were entrenched in traditions that were centuries old), within a period of five years? The government with all the resources at its disposal had hardly made a dent in the situation of poverty in the country in the last fifty years; how then did it expect the Sathins, who were at the lowest rung of society, to perform such wonders in just five years?
        <br><br>
        However, in 2003 the state elections were due, and by now the government had realised the potential of the Sathins for drawing votes. There was hence a complete shift in the governments’policy. There was a total reversal of the earlier decisions The government now announced expansion of WDP to all 32 districts, i.e. a total of 9189 Sathins.
        <br><br>
        There was confusion as to whether the union had benefited or had lost ground. The numbers of the Sathins had increased manifold, but the empowerment component of the programme was completely shelved. The Sathins in isolation were quite ineffective. Further, many of the original Sathins had discontinued work as they were over age. Meetings only took place in small groups, and the entire original group of Sathins did not meet at all.
        <br><br>
        However finally it became amply clear that while autonomy from funding and maintaining politically independent stance helped consolidate and build public opinion, it was the relationship to the state that was ultimately what really mattered. The course of things was to a very large extent defined by the state. The relationship of the women’s movement with the state perhaps needs to be looked at while dealing with the question of the nature of autonomy. That the autonomous women’s movement defines itself by its source of funding and political alliances needs to be reviewed and widened to include an understanding of the state. Mahila Shakti – Zindabad!
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">DISCUSSION FOLLOWING THE PRESENTATIONS</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Sai Kodai</b>, working with NIIT in Delhi shared her personal experience of growing up in a Dalit family that was very brahminical in its thinking. “I count myself fortunate that my feminism started in the Dalit movement. It didn’t start with a very academic approach. It was very natural, very organic. There was energy in the movement which is not there in the literature/academic mode where you discuss Virginia Woolf, you discuss Kamla Bhasin, you discuss and analyse. But you don’t question structures that are part of you. Which is actually more difficult to do. When Sarsi was talking, I identified with her honesty. Always confused whether to question Dalit oppression or patriarchal oppression.”
        <br><br>
        Taking forward the debate on entering electoral politics, <b>Malika</b> said, “In the Uttarakahand Mahila Manch, we feel that taking part in electoral politics means we are propping up a very weak democracy. The mechanisms to make leaders accountable, and the political consciousness among people, are not fully developed. In today’s electoral politics, you get sucked in. You are positing all your faith and power in a few elected representatives. UMM feels that through a people’s movement we bring about political consciousness so that if and when we enter the political arena, it is done with strength and when one is fully prepared.”
        <br><br>
        In response, <b>Shamim</b> reiterated, “Organisations like ours will never win elections the first time round. It takes a long time, and this is an extended period of political struggle. While it is necessary to get into politics fully prepared, with ideological clarity and maturity, these processes are not mutually exclusive. Unless you actually enter politics, you are never fully aware of what the dangers and pressures are. You have to take the plunge, despite the apprehensions. It’s like on-the-job-training.”
        <br><br>
        “Why do we not know the dangers, even before entering electoral politics? Do the voters not know in what kind of system they are operating? Don’t they understand who is honest and who is corrupt? It’s the compulsions of the system that makes them vote for the goons, despite recognising them,” responded <b>Malika</b>.
        <br><br>
        <b>Rajni</b> asks Uma, “How does the autonomous women’s movement view the anti-reservation movement in Delhi and all of India? After the anti-reservation stir, the harassment of Dalit doctors and students increased. The example of Dr Ajita who was thrown out of her job. We are hearing many incidents also of several Dalit girls being failed in medical exams by one or two marks.” Rajni also asked Saraswathi how she did not know which community she belonged to. “Despite middle class, or education, there are some things which tell you the discrimination you face.” She also asked her to point out the differences in attitude to Dalit writing in south India.
        <br><br>
        Said <b>Saraswathi</b>, “Of course, from my birth, I knew that I was Dalit. I have enjoyed reservation, had a caste certificate. There are various divisions, only I did not know that I belong to the cleaning community. I laughed and told my father, it is an organic link – I will ultimately reach where I have to reach i.e. to the cleaning community.”
        <br><br>
        Saraswathi went on to raise the question of funding. “For me, it is possible to raise money for Dalit issues and remain non-funded. We have four full timers, and are able to raise funds to support them. About writing, you cannot really call it ‘Dalit feminist writing’. There are some women Dalit writers who have started theorising – but for the larger world theorising and articulation is lacking. There is no documentation of this strong and vibrant movement. The whole Dalit question needs to be framed in a different way, in the context of reservation, globalisation and privatisation, liberalisation. Women’s groups should look at how patriarchy works differently in different caste structures. The wit and the wisdom of Dalit women are very important for women’s movement.
        <br><br>
        And responding to Rajni, <b>Uma</b> said, “There is a difference in the anti-reservation movement of the 1990s and now. Even in north India, there has been a difference. During the anti-Mandal stir, there was a confusion among women’s groups. In 1990, there was a visibility in the national media to the caste issue. There are several streams of the women’s movement, and some groups, like AIDWA did raise the issue. But I do agree that the connections that should have been made between women’s groups and Dalit women’s groups did not take place. The caste issue has made a critical input into the women’s movement. There has been some positive development, and this needs to be sharpened. Despite this, the sharp reaction to reservation is there. We need to change the terminology. Reservation sounds patronising, like a dole, and the baggage of this terminology should go. We should say either ‘affirmative action’, or ‘proportional representation’.”
        <br><br>
        Differing with Uma was <b>Ajita</b>, associated with Saheli. “When the Democratic Front was made on the reservation issue, with views slightly different from the hardcore Dalitwadis, I had a lot of expectations. But I had not a single friend from the progressive crowd come and stand by us.”
        <br><br>
        <b>Saraswathi</b>, sharing that this was a similar situation in Karnataka too, said, “There is an indifference. In Karnataka, many Dalit comrades asked – “When Sharanavva was made nude and paraded, where were the feminists?” They give lot instances. But I feel all these things can be addressed with a lot of patience and lot of respect. I always tell my Dalit (especially male) friends – who was Mathura, who was Bhanwari, who was Shah Banu? Who fought for them? Women’s groups in the whole country fought for them. In Karnataka, the first rape case taken up by Dalits groups was a non-Dalit woman. Whatever is positive, healthy and democratic in each movement, must be carried to other movement.”
        <br><br>
        <img src="${r2FetchArticleImgURL}Article1/3.png" style="width: 100%; display: block; padding-top: 5px;" />
        <br><br>
        <b>Janaki</b> too added that although we have come a long way, there is there is a sense of loneliness. “The anti-reservation agitation has done so much damage to people’s lives. The movement has to show its engagement with what we do.”
        <br><br>
        <b>Dr Ajita Gill</b>, speaking about her expulsion from her research job in AIIMS for participating in the pro-reservation rally, made a poignant intervention about the trauma of Dalit students. “Joined AIIMS in 1995. I have been made to feel that I come from the reserved category and suffered from an inferiority complex and like other Dalit students, I also used to get supplementary. The anti-reservation stir gave an outlet for all my anger over many years. I got into trouble with my supervisor, who didn’t accept arguments from a Dalit person. They as it is had grudges against me, alleging that I was not working hard. The issue was that I was not willing to unethically recruit people in the research!”
        <br><br>
        Moving from the reservation issue, <b>Sandhya</b> from Forum highlighted the fact that marginalised communities like Muslims or Dalits have men from their community standing by them. And the entire community can question the women’s movement for not standing by them. But lesbian women and gay men, or men who are not considered men – who will raise their issues? No questions are being addressed even in this audience, and we need to think why.”
        <br><br>
        <b>Kiran</b>, responding to Sandhya’s query about whether a union of the informal sector (like the Sathin Union) now needs to transform into a women’s organisation, said, “We are exploring possibilities about how to take the issue forward. We are also discussing with all of you, and want inputs from everyone. The Sathins have undergone a process of deep politicisation, and this needs to be taken forward, along with others who support the Sathins.”
        <br><br>
        Coming to the question of funding, <b>Nilanjana</b> said, “When working in Bangalore in Manasa, and also with sexuality rights groups, we used to get stuck on the issue of funding and autonomy. We were told “you must ask this question later”. But when will ‘later’ come?”
        <br><br>
        In response, <b>Chayanika</b> replied, “Today, the campaign against Section 377 has come up in a very important way. It is doubtless an important issue. But for us (lesbians, trans) it is not a big issue. We listed three issues – (1) decriminalisation (2) protection from discrimination – is a very big issue if one can’t even come out. Repression, violence, leading to migration, displacement etc. (3) And the third issue is – what are the positive rights we want to ask for? We have not talked about that. We are stuck at just trying to say we are citizens. But there was no hierarchy of the levels – we had to struggle at all levels. But the 377 campaign is focussed on a legal campaign alone.
        <br><br>
        Everybody is talking about sexual behaviours only, which is linked to the issue of funding. Men, and queer men too, still have space (in public) available. There’s lots of discrimination for queer men too, but still they have more public space. Various identities are being defined for men based on class, sexual behaviour etc, defined due to funding. According to us, that is not the issue. For lesbian women, we don’t have even one word. For gay men, there are hundreds of words, based on behaviours. These words – kothis, panthis etc. is very problematic, because it is also class based. But it denies these categories a choice of lifestyle.
        <br><br>
        We have lost the language of sexuality rights. We talked of reproductive rights in the women’s movement. And in Beijing, sexual rights. What is the agenda and understanding of sexual rights?”
        <br><br>
        Ranjana and Laxmi summed up the discussion... the presentations, each so rich, had raised many questions. Questions that the movement would have to tackle with criticality and sharp analysis, as well as solidarity with different autonomous movements.
        <br><br>
        Given the job of thank yous, <b>Deepti</b> said, “When we started this whole process, documenting history, our friends and well wishers said to us ‘Why are you so self critical’. So now we are going to break from tradition and say thank you only to us Sahelis! So thank you all Sahelis! There are many people we want to thank. All of you who have come here today to share this occasion, those who could not come but are here in spirit, all our speakers, those who came up and shared your thoughts. I don’t know what to say – it was overwhelming and humbling.” She also thanked our printers – Sandeep, Shafi and Dhananjay, who ‘worked like crazy with us crazy women’ to bring out this document literally overnight; Anindita for the posters she made; Anjali Deshpande for translation, Chopraji our electrician for the free fan in our office, and Lakshmi who came and cleaned our office everyday with a smile. And to all the founder members and all the women who have made the place and this day what it is – to all of them – Zindabad!!”
        <br><br>
        And <b>Nilanjana</b> added, “I know everyone would like to thank the volunteers of Saheli for all the hard work and putting this together. It’s been wonderful! A fantastic opportunity. Thank you so much!
        <br><br>
        After the song Sanghathith Ho, everyone made their way to the Saheli office under the flyover for a dinner of Deez Biryani (of course!).
        <br><br>
        And as the evening turned into night, and the days into weeks, the memories, the warmth, the togetherness of that day lives on… and the hope that we can move forward together with renewed strength.

        <div style="font-size:12px; color: #f2287f;">A morning to remember...</div>
        <br>
        An indignant, “Hey, where’s my name?!”… followed by a pleased, “Aha, there it is…!” Women peering over each other’s shoulders, stretching up to find their names inscribed on a white banner in various colours, in different handwritings. Names of all the women who have ever been in Saheli. Names gleaned from old daily diaries, minutes books, letters, e-mails and word of mouth. An attempt to record what was hitherto only oral history.
        <br><br>
        Bal Bhawan on August 12, 2006, was witness to a historic occasion: Saheli completes 25 years of activism. As Kalpana, one of the founder members succinctly put it, “One of our main achievements is that 25 years have gone by, and we are still here. When Saheli started in 1981, we did not know how far we would come. The values have not changed. The faces have changed, of course. The flyover is the same…we keep thinking it will fall, but it still hasn’t. I want to congratulate ourselves, those who have gone by and those who are here, as well as those who will come, for keeping us going for a long long time.”
        <br><br>
        Almost two hundred women came – 3 months old to 80 years, from Mumbai and Munsiyari, Betul and Bangalore, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Pune, Kolkata and Canada. The invitations had gone more than four months earlier, and everyone made time to be with Saheli. And it was a day for matters of the heart, of politics, of memories…of togetherness. Some the past, some the present, and all the future of Saheli. Old friends and new, milling around and sipping tea, some taking a quick bath, until they were ushered into the hall, decorated with glorious posters and banners that we had put together for the occasion.
        <br><br>
        <i>“Hey Jee Re .. Hey Jee Re ..”</i> the sounds of the old favourite song filled the room, as more people filtered in to take their seats on the steps of the amphitheatre.
        <br><br>
        The meeting to mark 25 years was an occasion to take stock of what kind of autonomy we had dreamed of in 1981 and what is the practice in the reality of today’s changing world – seen through presentations by Saheli as well as a sharing of experiences and analyses by friends from other autonomous movements.
        <br><br>
        And with Vani conducting the show, the morning had begun!
        <br><br>
        Shweta, who confessed that she was very nervous, gave a brief introduction to what Saheli is, and who we are, along with showing pictures projected on a screen on stage. Photographs of the first office in Gouri’s garage, with the cane chairs and table, drew appreciative laughs from the audience – not to mention the gasps when we told everyone that we still sit on the very same chair underthe flyover today! Shweta stressed that there has been a continuity in our political perspective, while we have changed in response to newer challenges.
        <br><br>
        “Every member of Saheli has come with different hopes, and expectations… some emotional, others political and yet others…something else… Everyone’s life situation has been different. The attempt has always been to move forward keeping in mind differing needs, talents, skills, weaknesses and strengths,” she added.
        <br><br>
        The source of our strength has been our friends, supporters and co-travellers, who have always stood by us – right from the very beginning until now. There are some who may have never stepped into our office, but feel linked to Saheli’s politics, and sometimes demand accountability from us!
        <br><br>
        Saheli has touched many lives… and who knows where, how and which Saheli one will encounter! When we asked some of the women who do not or cannot come to Saheli for whatever reasons, why they had left Saheli, they replied, “Who said we have left Saheli? We have NOT left Saheli!”
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">CHALLENGING INEQUALITIES...</b>
        <br><br>
        Vani illustrated how Saheli’s significant contribution has been to visibilise and challenge inequalities. “Saheli has never been a very large organisation, and the question, for generations of Sahelis has been: is smallness a weakness, or a strength? Can we make a difference?
        <br><br>
        We started as a ‘women’s space’ – a campaign group that sought to reach out to women facing domestic violence. And from our handling of this we learnt that there is a deeper silence that needs to be broken. Today, an autorickshaw driver knows what a ‘mahila sanghathan’ is – but 25 years ago the concept of a ‘women’s space’ was novel. For women to come out of the domestic space and claim public space, was almost revolutionary. To draw connections between domestic violence and the societal sanction for it, and the inequalities in law that serve to isolate women, as well as the links between unequal property laws and community identity.
        <br><br>
        Similarly it was a group of women in Patancheru who discovered unethical trials of the injectable contraceptive Net En. Saheli has played a role to make visible the linkages between health policies and violence against women, hazardous contraceptives, the national agenda of population control and its impact on women.
        <br><br>
        And so also for communalism - to make the connections between the trauma that women were going through in a private space like the family… and its connections with larger questions of religious and community identity, social and judicial processes… seeking change… seeking accountability from the state and its institutions, the discrimination in laws, especially personal laws. We sought to make ‘women’s issues’ public issues.
        <br><br>
        At the same time… we believe we need to constantly push for change, while also learning from various other movements. If visibilising is the first step, we also know there is much more to fight for… in our strategies, the changes we hope for… the world we dream of.
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">VISIBILISING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</b>
        <br><br>
        With photographs to illustrate, Vani continued to talk about Saheli’s work on violence. Saheli started in 1981 out of the campaigns against dowry and custodial rape in the late 1970s, which shook the country and catalysed the emergence of women’s groups in several cities. Mathura, Rameeza Bi, Maya Tyagi, Sudha Goel… became symbols of the women’s movement these issues and the issue of domestic violence remained the focus of Saheli’s work... like much of Saheli work... is not just ours... it is all of ours, especially the many women in the room, whose history/legacy we were sharing with each other!
        <br><br>
        Rallies against violence were unheard of until we began breaking the silence around issues like domestic violence. Violence inside homes that had social sanction… the sanction of the state and the police. In the early years, Saheli’s work with women in crisis was marked by direct/street action. From demonstrations outside in-laws homes where women had been murdered for dowry; going and retrieving stri-dhan and a woman’s belongings from her marital home; demanding accountability in workplaces where women had been harassed... shaming men who beat their wives… there were many ways Saheli responded to situations. So much so that some women approached Saheli to ‘demonstrate on demand!’
        <br><br>
        Our work on rape has not been restricted to policy level alone. Street protests, reaching out to the public, and attempting to change the culture of acceptance of rape as a ‘normal’ part of society, has been an important aspect of our campaign. ‘DILLI, CHUPPI TODO, HINSA ROKO’ (Break the Silence! Stop the Violence!) was how we appealed to the silent spectators on the street. We also distributed leaflets in crowded bazaars, in street corners and on the University campus. Stickers declaring ‘NO MORE VIOLENCE’ made their presence felt in many parts of Delhi, on cars and scooters. Through rallies and ‘TAKE BACK THE NIGHT’ actions, we have attempted to reclaim our space, and our right to move around freely on the streets of Delhi – by day or by night. Trying to reach out in public spaces, using posters etc. Yet, as women’s groups, we have been unable to tackle the spiralling violence against women in the city. There is a growing tolerance to violence, even within women’s groups. There perhaps needs to be a re-look and perhaps change in strategy.
        <br><br>
        Simultaneously, like other groups, we have engaged with law reform, and using the judiciary. Knowing fully well the limitations, and that the law and judiciary are entrenched in patriarchy. Yet, we have had to engage with the legal system, which does set some benchmarks for what is right and wrong, and provides some access for redressal for women. This has been a problematic question, with which all activist groups, and women’s groups have continued to engage. We continue to fight for laws, fight with the NCW, and fight for implementation, while being aware of what a limited impact legal reform can have – whether in the case of 498A, domestic violence, amendment to rape and dowry laws.
        <br><br>
        One of the main areas we have worked on recently is sexual harassment at the workplace. We have engaged with it at many levels. After the Vishakha judgement in the Supreme Court, we realised that most women were not even aware of the judgement. So we did a survey – going to and talking to women about the issue, raising awareness - and brought out a report called ‘Another Occupational Hazard’. After that, we developed a play <i>Mahaul Badalna Hai</i>. But our engagement with the issue has been long standing. When we looked at old daily diaries of the 1980s, we came across cases of women coming and telling us how their male colleagues would harass them.
        <br><br>
        We also did crisis intervention, individual handling of cases, and ran a shelter for four years. Simultaneously, we have always felt we must reach out. One of the areas we have had a strong linkage with is universities in Delhi. With Delhi University …linkages with Gender Studies Group - DU, Forum Against Sexual Harassment, Campaign for a Safe University; with JNU Gender Sensitization Committee Against Sexual Harassment. And on a positive note, we also do feminist self-defence workshops or Wenlido, with college students, activists, transgendered, women working in corporations etc.
        <br><br>
        The play, Om Swaha was sort of a marker in the movement. There was another spontaneous street play following a rape in a nearby school in Lajpat Nagar. Our play on sexual harassment, Mahaul Badalna Hai, involved a longer process – developing a play out of the survey, out of women’s experiences; developing it, and taking it out. We took it to a variety of places – from a May Day rally, to a domestic workers’ union, to a college event.
        <br><br>
        We also dealt with dilemmas along the way. Working on sexual harassment, in a context where there is a proliferation of NGOs poses a peculiar problem. For public sector companies, there is a state, or a management. Confronting is relatively easy – you can put pressure, tell them there is a law, etc. When it comes to NGOs, how do you exert that same pressure? To some extent they are ‘our’ people, with ‘our’ politics. How do we evolve strategies without getting divided? These are some of the questions we face.
        <br><br>
        How do we cope with the scale of violence that is growing –from sex selective abortion to communal violence to individual cases of rape, violence on lesbian women… the range is enormous, and we are also coming across nuances. Like many other groups, we too are grappling with these questions.
        <img src="${r2FetchArticleImgURL}Article2/2.png" style="width: 100%; display: block; padding-top: 5px;" />
        <br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">WOMEN AND HEALTH CAMPAIGNS IN SAHELI</b>
        <br><br>
        Going on to talk about Saheli’s work on women’s health, Vineeta mentioned that campaigns on women and health have always had an important place in Saheli. She focused on the strategies we adopted, and the methods we used to reach out to people. Reaching out to the public however was not the only method used – we also filed court cases, attended public hearings, raised questions in Parliament, lobbied with MPs, released press statements and wrote articles. We also dialogued with the government, and attempted to pressurise them – be it the ICMR or Health Ministry, or occasionally the Drugs Controller – with whom we have never had a good relationship! We have gheraoed him, shouted slogans, and probably made him wish these women would go away and leave him alone. But we had a responsibility to protest about hazardous contraceptives and drugs for women, and we did!
        <br><br>
        Besides this, we work along with several groups – both within the country and internationally. In fact, there are many of you here who, along with us, became decoy customers to expose the illegal sale of drugs. Other forms we used were - intervening in meetings and raising questions and protesting, signature campaigns – in early days on paper and now on e-mail. The use of e-mail petitions, while undoubtedly helping to garner support fast, has also come in for its share of criticism and they have their weaknesses and strengths. We have been using the newsletter and reports from time to time, and the document such as the one brought out specially to commemorate Saheli’s 25 years to publicise our views.
        <br><br>
        We also developed a play on Norplant. To take to the streets with a play on hazardous contraceptives was not easy. The subject of contraceptives is not easy to broach face to face – such was the situation 15 years ago, and it continues till date. We have also sung songs – whether or not they were tuneful! Parchis, leaflets have also been used.
        <br><br>
        The slides Vineeta showed kept the audience rapt. The picture of Saheli’s ‘Red Book’ on contraception and women’s health, the poster against population policy, the poster demanding a ban on sex determination tests, and an old parchi (pamphlet) about a workshop on women and health, with the contact address as Gouri and Buchy and the old Nizamuddin address!
        <br><br>
        Summing up our work on women’s health, Vineeta said, “25 years is a long time, and it is tempting to ask what we have achieved.”
        <br><br>
        Estrogen-Progesterone drugs was one of the early campaigns. The drug was used for a variety of reasons. There was a ban in the 1980s, but EP drugs are now being used for hormone replacement.
        <br><br>
        Sex determination, after a long struggle, was banned in Maharashtra, and then a central law in 1994. After a PIL, the PCPNDT amendments were passed. But even now, we don’t know if the Act has teeth.There has been just one conviction so far.
        <br><br>
        Hazardous drugs – it is a long and complicated story. The list is long -Net En, Depo Provera, Norplant, Quinacrine sterilisation, and there are anti-fertility vaccines. With Net En and Depo, many things have happened since Patancheru (where the first illegal trials were exposed). A case in the Supreme Court was successful in stalling the introduction of Net En into the family planning programme for 14 years.
        <br><br>
        Norplant too is about to be introduced and Quinacrine sterilisation is still being illegally used, particularly in Bengal. Trials on anti-fertility vaccines have been indefinitely shelved – perhaps due to the weight of the campaign, and also due to scientific objections. This too can be counted as a success.
        <br><br>
        But as far as clinical trials go, we also raised the ethical dimensions. Matters of informed consent in clinical trials have been an important aspect about which we have written and also protested.
        <br><br>
        The importance of autonomous politics in the sphere of women’s health cannot be emphasised more. To remain independent of government as well as funding agencies, and stick to our views is crucial. This independent stand in the women’s health movement (vis-a-vis funding) has been severely jeopardised over the past 10-15 years, and this is a question before us.
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">CAMPAIGNING AGAINST COMMUNALISM</b>
        <br><br>
        Sadhna recounted some of Saheli’s work on communalism, the strategies used and the challenges we face. When Saheli started, no one could have known what was in store for us. While we began to fight against rape, domestic violence and dowry, and even against the building of sati temples, we began to realise that it is not sufficient to fight against these alone. The forces of communalism are very strong and complex, and a huge challenge before us. This challenge continues till date. The way in which religion is used/manipulated, customs, traditions and culture - it is extremely complex.
        <br><br>
        Saheli’s struggle against communalism has been at various levels. First, the campaign against communalism involved understanding the way in which family, community and marriage exerted their control on women. Relief and rehabilitation during communal violence has always been an area of our response, right from the 1984 anti-Sikh carnage. Second, fighting against communal hatred in society and working towards peace. Our work has also focussed on punishing the guilty in communal riots. Another important aspect, especially since 1992, which women’s groups in particular have raised, is the manner in which communal forces have used women’s bodies to spread communal hatred, especially the sexual violence in Gujarat in 2002.
        <br><br>
        In 1984, we concentrated on relief and rehabilitation, and spreading the message of communal harmony. The specific ways in which communal violence affects women was not so central to our work or perspective. But the ways in which women’s lives were specifically impacted, and the manner in which communal forces were getting more and more strengthened, and the consequent impact on women’s lives, eventually became central to our understanding. Gradually, we saw the way in which communalism began to play a central role in Indian politics – and the nexus between religion and politics began to play itself out on women’s lives. Be it Shah Banu or the debate on the ‘Egalitarian Civil Code’(ECC). Another disturbing aspect was the way in which women increasingly were being used by communal forces, and becoming ‘communal agents’, spreading communal hatred. In 2002 in Gujarat, women’s bodies were directly used to dishonour the other community by raping and murdering women.
        <br><br>
        Through case work too, we could clearly see how communities and religion controlled women’s lives. We intervened in inter-caste, inter-religious marriages, dealt with inequalities in personal laws, and confronted the lack of rights for women in the family. The manner in which personal laws reinforced the unequal status of women in the family became apparent, and it was clear that we had to struggle for women’s rights within the family. Even as the impact of communalism in society began to increase, it became more and more difficult to raise the issue of women and personal laws. At Saheli, our perspective has been to articulate women’s rights within the family, understanding women’s unequal status within the family, as well as inequality in religious laws. We felt that this issue had to be taken out of the framework of minority and majority religions, and looked at as one of women’s domestic labour. Second, we felt that to disentangle the issue from the religious debate, we had to take a perspective of democracy and citizenship. That women must have equal rights as citizens in this society. The women’s movement has faced these pressures, and with the growth of communalism, has come even more under pressure. Without going into the debate in detail here, it is enough to say that by now, it appears that the women’s movement has somewhat settled to a position of reform within personal laws, through which women’s lives will improve.
        <br><br>
        The sati issue was portrayed as one of ‘tradition’ vs ‘modernity’, ‘Indian’ vs ‘Western’. We were always small in numbers – 12 or 20, even in rallies, and the pro-sati forces always had huge numbers with them. We have always had to face this backlash that we are out to ‘spoil’ ordinary women, and the anti-sati campaign was also seen in this light. This engagement, since 1987, was a long campaign not only against sati, but also against the glorification of sati, the building of sati temples etc. We see that laws are quick in coming, but implementation is not effective. This too has been a question for us.
        <br><br>
        These campaigns are a solid example of joint alliances and working together – on the anti-sati campaign, and the campaign for ECC. We have drawn a lot of strength working together, and have also given a lot to joint campaigns. Of late, inter-caste marriages and the resultant caste-based violence has come up in a big way.
        <br><br>
        Our attempt has always been to have a clear position on various issues – through campaigns and alliances. But in terms of strategies, we are still grappling with how to confront the growing impact of tradition, religion, community and family on women’s lives. Not only at the level of politics, but in civil society, media, the market – rituals and customs are being used in a big way. It’s really difficult to make any breakthrough in that. How do we see religion in our own lives? At a political level, and social level? And how do ordinary people look at religion? How do we bridge this gap? What kind of strategies can we use? It is a big challenge before us. We need more clarity in our thoughts, and clear strategies to deal with this very complex situation we are in.
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">RELEVANCE OF AUTONOMOUS POLITICS</b>
        <br><br>
        Laxmi went on to outline the relevance of autonomous politics today. Many historic documents of Saheli state that Saheli did not start with any manifesto or blueprint for the revolution. Our own experiences were the starting point of our analysis…linking personal to political, a slogan that has been crucial for the movement. Autonomous politics is usually defined in the negative – that we are not affiliated to a party or government, we don’t take funds, but what is the meaning of autonomous politics? What is the fundamental core?
        <br><br>
        Whatever change we want to bring about in society, we begin the transformation within the organisation itself. We start from a notion of collective functioning, non-hierarchy and democracy within the organisation. Oppressed people – whether women, Dalits, workers, adivasis, homosexuals… if we want to give everyone equal opportunities in society, where no one dominates, imposes their views on others, or crushes the other, we have to apply these principles even within the organisation. We have tried to follow these principles, even if we may not have been successful all the time. We cannot say there is absolutely no hierarchy or power. But we can definitely say that this is our dream, and we keep discussing, acting and trying to find ways to make it a reality.
        <br><br>
        We work together with others to bring this change – within ourselves, our organisation and within society. There are many autonomous groups here – from Mumbai, and also from Delhi. We make no bones about the fact that we have to work with others. And we do not apologise for being small (though we do lament in secret!). But whichever campaigns we have taken up it is clear that although a small group, we are able to make a lot of noise. It has been a very natural part of our politics. While conducting a campaign against violence recently with the ‘Dilli Chuppi Todo’ placard, only seven of us were on the flyover, and thousands of people could see what we were saying. Even in health campaigns –right from the early 1980s, we dared to stand up and say that population was not the reason for poverty, but the other way round. No one wanted to hear it at the time. We also protested against hazardous contraceptives and how women’s bodies were being targeted – no one wanted to hear that either. We slowly managed to convince the Left, the socialists, and other progressives, to see our point of view. And now there is a consensus, 25 years later, that we must all fight against population control. So when we talk of strategic alliances, who do we work with – issue-based alliances with broad range of progressive organisations. In communalism, we were part of Nagrik Ekta Manch, SVA, PMS and Aman Ekta Manch. We participate in joint forms, taking with us our feminist politics.
        <br><br>
        Another important point of autonomy is funding. We raise money from individuals for our work, survive on volunteer power and do not take institutional funding, of which we have a very deep critique. It’s not that we have never taken institutional funding – we have taken, for some projects. This too was the subject of much debate. But for the past 20 years, we have not taken any institutional funding for our work.
        <br><br>
        This critique of institutional funding evolves from our critique of institutionalised feminism. It comes from the government – whether the Women’s Development Programmes of Rajasthan and UP, or the Women’s Commission’s set up. There are many people associated with these programs here in this room – and we would like to keep the discussion going, the dialogue open on this issue. Our critique has often been misinterpreted to mean that we will not work with these institutions. But we engage with them with all our criticality – whether the National Commission for Women or the UN or the Beijing processes.
        <br><br>
        Current challenges – communalism, militarisation and the market economy overshadow our reality. In the context of these larger forces, can we make a difference?
        <br><br>
        The answer is a big YES! We will definitely bring change. And this faith is because we do not see our politics in terms of big or small, but in terms of the sharpness of our perspectives – where do we fight, and what strategies to adopt. We also have faith that we will bring about change because you are all with us, and together we will bring change.
        <br><br>
        And this was an ideal point to laugh at ourselves, through the song <i>‘Naarivaad behna dhire dhire aayi’</i> (Feminism …. A long time coming!), a take off on <i>‘Samajwaad Babua’</i> – Gorakh Pande’s hard hitting satire of socialism. Through this song, we take pot shots at the labels of ‘Western’, ‘city-bred’, funded feminists; the co-option of women’s issues by all political parties, and the State; and also make digs at the confusion of collective functioning arising out of our allergy to domination! The Left too comes in for its share of spoof, as we satirise their fear of the ‘L’ word and marginalisation of lesbians.

        Thunderous applause, continuing as we all filed out for much needed tea.
        <br><br>
        And we came back to a lighter look at collective functioning – a spoof on Saheli’s group process while trying to develop a play on sexual harassment at the workplace. Enacting a typical scene at a weekly organisational meeting touched a chord in all of the veteran meeting goers and drew many laughs.
        <br><br>
        The finale, singing ‘Mahaul Badalna Hai’ from the play had the audience clapping along.
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">RELEASE OF THE HISTORY DOCUMENT</b>
        <br><br>
        Akshara, summing up the past few months as the ‘horrors of the collective’, gave a brief background into the process of documenting the history of Saheli. “We went back to the Daily Diaries and minutes books for the past 25 years. For people who have not been in Saheli for very long, it was very exciting looking at conversations by people who we had only heard about but not met and as for older Sahelis, they got completely side tracked because they would be looking at minutes books and saying ‘Oh, I said that that day?’ or ‘When did I ever say that’. Some of the new people felt a little left out!” Relating her discovery in a file of a parchi of the first anti-sati rally in early November 1987, Akshara had the audience in splits when she admitted, “It struck me yesterday... that of everyone here, I’m the only one who is younger than Saheli!”
        <br><br>
        Talking about one of the other sources of information for the history document was a series of interviews with old Sahelis and new. She pointed to Ashima, now sitting silently in the audience, who for the last few months had been dedicatedly following up and making sure we got responses – thanks to her now famous, ‘wee reminders’. We spoke to a lot of people, met whoever we could meet. And they told us about their interpretation of Saheli history. And as is the case with any history which has interpretations, we had varied responses. We’ve had nostalgic ones, regretful ones, bitter ones. So we put together a document which presents a broad history of the autonomous women’s movement over the past 25 years, with regard to Saheli’s role in it. And there’s no way that such a document can hope to be exhaustive, nor can we claim that our interpretation of Saheli’s history is truer or more valid than any other. We’ve also tried to put together this history as faithfully as possible because we were, and still are in the process of creating it.
        <br><br>
        Nidhi then went on to translate what Akshara said into Hindi.
        <br><br>
        Taking the mike, Deepti reiterated that making the document has been the result of the effort of many many people – a genuine collective effort. So its release too must be collective. “I would like to call some people up to the stage. The founder members present here: Gouri, Rukmini, Kalpana, Vichitra.. please come up,” called Deepti, amidst much hooting and clapping.
        <br><br>
        And others associated since 1981 were also called on the stage - Abha, Chandra, Prabeen, Malika, Savita, Urmil, Elizabeth, Jayashri, Nilanjana, Ranjana, Runu, Ajita.
        <br><br>
        “Two people without whom this document would not have been possible. Who worked hard, helped us to maintain our sanity and took on major responsibilities on their shoulders – Ashima and Nalini. A special thank you to them!”
        <br><br>
        Calling on the camera-shy Sahelis also to come: Divya, Shweta, Vani, Sarvesh, Vimla, Vidya, Jyotika, Rajni, Kamla, Radha and many more, without whom we cannot be on the stage!
        <br><br>
        And any of those who want to join Saheli – all of you come up too! And someone comes!
        <br><br>
        Adds Deepti, “The Sahelis you see on stage here, it is not a complete picture. One of our close comrades, Satnam, is ill, so cannot be here. And Davi is sitting in Durban and Lata in London. We are missing all of them acutely on this occasion!”
        <br><br>
        Holding hands, in a circle, the purple history document, still hot off the press, is waved in the air. Some of us can hardly believe that it’s printed! We were proof reading it just two days ago!
        <br><br>
        And with everyone on stage, we sing “Hey jee rey” again.
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">A TIME FOR SHARING</b>
        <br><br>
        Says Vani, “Now is the time we would like to hear from you about Saheli, about yourselves, about the dosti, the fights, the work, the action… everything.” And the perfect person to start with is, Kalpana.
        <br><br>
        Beginning with congratulating everyone for keeping Saheli going all these years, <b>Kalpana</b>, a founder member also said that these are very difficult days. “The links with younger people have lessened. Many have gone to NGOs, since you can do revolution and also get paid for it. Voluntary efforts have gone down. We need to think how to go ahead in this scenario. Another change is that in the beginning, it was important to establish our identity as the women’s movement. But the sweeping changes and challenges we need to respond to – the biggest challenge is how can feminism bring another dimension to larger society?”
        <br><br>
        She also regretted that Delhi and Mumbai are deaf to issues outside of metros. Unfortunately, if the government is centralised in Delhi, the movement also tends to get centralised. Delhi has the media, the courts, the contacts, far more resources to raise issues. Saheli needs to extend its support and solidarity to movements in smaller towns.
        <br><br>
        <b>Rukmini</b>, also a founder member, who had left Saheli in 1989 to go to Hyderabad and work with rural women, responded to Kalpana’s comment about working in NGOs. “All of us have to do jobs,” she said. “Saheli is a very important part of our lives – we squabbled a lot, but we knew we could call people up anytime, when you needed them. Our love and support for each other was immense.”
        <br><br>
        “About autonomy – on the one hand we are supposed to be autonomous. On the other hand, we live in a society, where we are not at all autonomous. The conference in Kolkata – women coming from NGOs, and their aspirations are that they want to work in an autonomous way. The work and understanding I got in Saheli I have applied wherever I went. All my learning is from Saheli. Saheli is like a source of inspiration. Leadership for women, and male support is the focus of our work in mixed organisations. I am especially happy to see so many youngsters. And I hope the spirit of Saheli will go on very strongly.”
        <br><br>
        And then a butterfly fluttered on to the stage, in the shape of <b>Saraswati</b> from Bangalore. “For me, the politics we are talking about, is very precious. I will act out and show what I feel. Whatever are our ideals, they are like butterflies. We are seeing that.. but it is very difficult to catch. And when you do catch, you just have to put it inside, and it keeps fluttering. Without speaking, I want to show it.” She goes on the stage and catches a butterfly, and becomes one herself!
        <br><br>
        <b>Mallika</b>, who was around 21 when she joined Saheli and became part of the movement in Delhi, said, “We also have our roots in Saheli and then took different routes… moved on to translate our politics into practice.” Now living in the mountains and the Sarpanch of her Van (forest) Panchayat, Malika farms the land and is also part of a women’s group - Maati. Now our struggle is different. ‘Personal is political’ is something that we understand. But the political is also personal! What is happening to people in the mountains? Our lives are linked to the mountains/forests/water/grass. Now we are getting to experience first hand the impact of globalisation on women’s lives. How, when there is no ownership of resources, life and livelihood is devastated. We keep coming back to Saheli, because we hope that you become the face of our struggle, our voice.. and keep alive a relationship that goes back 25 years. And go on for 50..100 years!”
        <br><br>
        From Nainital, <b>Uma Pant</b> brings out a quarterly newsletter, Uttara. Following the Kanpur conference of the autonomous women’s movement in 1993, she went back and began a small organisation – Maitri, working on women’s issues and social issues. In 1994, during the struggle for Uttarakhand state, Maitri joined the movement, and Uttarakhand Mahila Manch (UMM) emerged. “The Manch is not in good shape…we keep meeting, having discussions, we do some work...keep leaving...and then joining again. And coming here, we hope to get strength from all of you, and be part of the laughter, the spirit and solidarity” she said.
        <br><br>
        <b>Jamuna</b>, speaking in Telugu, with Rukmini translating, related how, in 1986 she used to come from 40 km away in Ghaziabad, but would find it useful and valuable to come for even one hour. She spoke of her own journey from a political secretary to a leader in the ML movement, to gaining feminist consciousness through her own personal struggle. She now runs Gramya, a women’s group in Hyderabad.
        <br><br>
        Well known feminist writer <b>Vidya Bal</b> from Pune, drew many laughs when she said, “There are many reasons for me to be here, but one of the main ones is that Vineeta is my daughter. And in this crowd, I would like to introduce myself as Vineeta’s mother. I remember days 20-30 years back, when everybody asked her, because she was always introduced as my daughter, whether she writes. And she was disgusted with this question!” Vidya Tai also shared that her organisation back home ‘Nari Samata Manch, is also going to complete 25 years next year.
        <br><br>
        <b>Kalpana</b> who was known as ‘Kalpana of Jagori’ because there was a Kalpana of Saheli, said, “At such gatherings we have the founding mothers of these organisations, and they come up and say “It’s so nice to see young people”. And people like us are not founders of anything. And we no longer qualify as ‘young’. But a whole lot of us here are very much part of the movement, who have grown up in the movement. It’s a different space we occupy. Not founders, and no longer young.” For me, it has been a friendship with Saheli in many ways. Individual activists – Sadhna, Ranjana, Vani, Laxmi –have been my friends, and we have grown together in many movements. For us from Jagori, being two women’s organisations in Delhi, if anything happens, the first person you call up is Saheli. And I hope Saheli also calls us up first! (yes.. yes.. someone murmurs)
        <br><br>
        “Being part of a women’s organisation that is also an NGO, having a group like Saheli to work with keeps us on our toes, and that is the role that Saheli has played. Though they are irritating at times, it’s nice to have groups like Saheli, and other such groups to work with and consistently keep discussing our politics and figure out where we are going as a movement. And to be able to reflect honestly, at the times when we feel we are down. Whatever the history between Jagori and Saheli and many other groups, we need spaces to reflect together on where we are going...what are the issues, what is our politics, who are our alliances. But at the end of it all…Saheli, you are an inspiration to all of us and we value your friendship tremendously,” added Kalpana.
        <br><br>
        “I don’t know what to say... You are all one of us... This is not the time to get tangled up in debates and issues. We are all carrying a big chunk of history. .. and to keep that history going, to carry that history on...” said <b>Abha</b>. Relating the experience of anti-war in Lebanon rally with very few protesters, Abha said, “We were acutely feeling that we should broaden, get more inclusive. And the questions about autonomous politics – yes, all that is true. But for our voices to get stronger, we need to go beyond. I want to think together about how to build a movement.”
        <br><br>
        Said Abha, while volunteering to come for a Saturday meeting in Saheli, after not climbing up the stairs since the split, “A little bending down is not so bad. For our politics, for the purpose of building a wider, stronger movement. We have to discuss issues threadbare... but let’s not despair, but take this time to build together.”
        <br><br>
        After Gouri too added that she would come on Saturdays, Vani remarked that such gestures are some of the best gifts we could get.
        <br><br>
        <b>Anchal</b>, now in Kriti, a non-funded resource centre, came to Saheli in her first year of college. “Saheli was my first word into feminism, in the way it stood for autonomous politics. I took the way Saheli was set up back to LSR and set up the Women’s Development Cell,” she said. “Saheli for me has been a form where different people, doing different kinds of jobs can put their creative energies and their politics and create something solid. Saheli stands for a solid women’s group across the board, across the country. Four chairs, 9 volunteers is what we started out with 7 years ago in Kriti. I think it’s really possible to not take grants and put our energies to create something that is beautiful and politically strong.”
        <br><br>
        <b>Sarojini</b>, who was in Jagori for 7-8 years, and now in Sama, regaled the audience with her re-telling of the first time she came to Saheli. “When I first came, for the screening of ‘In the name of medicine’, I was so tense. I don’t know how I climbed those steps. I thought everyone would tear me apart because I was from Jagori! I had heard so much about Kalpana from Saheli – and I was scared. But the film was interesting, and I relaxed, and then I went back.” Abha encouraged Sarojini to interact with Saheli on issues of population and contraceptives. “I learnt a lot. Kalpana insisted I develop rigour in my work and made me read multi-centre trials! Now I can critique very well!”
        <br><br>
        Echoing the spirit of collectivity, <b>Prabeen</b> said, “Firstly, we must all congratulate ourselves. The one thought that led to the formation of Saheli – this thought is still carried forward: that our doors, and our minds will always be open to all women.” Bringing up serious matters of cleaning, Prabeen continued, “I would do jhadoo very conscientiously (maybe because I’m a Virgo), and Gouri would do it. But the rest would leave the place in a dump! A huge big debate – do all feminists have to be dirty, and do all feminists not have to tweeze their eyebrows? And that’s an ongoing debate.”
        <br><br>
        <b>Chayanika</b> from Forum, Mumbai called the relationship with Saheli “like twin organisations, but non-identical twins in two different cities. We call each other up all the time. When there is a difference of opinion with Saheli, it makes us very restless. It forces us to think.”
        <br><br>
        Another compliment from <b>Jaya</b> of Nirantar and Prism was that Saheli’s involvement in anything has both depth and enthusiasm/ vigour. “PRISM has a special relationship with Saheli. There are very few such groups that function as a forum and not institution. There are many challenges – how to combine activism and the pressures of daily life, earning money. Saheli stands as an example of what is possible. For queer issues – and their connections with class, caste, sexuality – are apparent in Saheli’s work and politics. Saheli office has been very important to us in PRISM and Voices. Several meetings take place there. Saheli space is one where you feel a sense of belonging – you don’t feel an outsider. So we can’t even say we thank Saheli, because we feel a sense of belonging in that space.”
        <br><br>
        <b>Kavita Srivastava</b> from Jaipur, who described herself as a ‘hard core feminist’ lamented that she often is left out of feminist spaces because she works with mixed forums like civil liberties groups. “Saheli represents the fountainhead of the ideology of feminism which we all got attracted to. We began in the government-run WDP. But if groups like Saheli and Jagori did not exist, we would have had no connection to the women’s movement. I love feminist spaces and I love what Saheli represents. We need to see – what are the threads that connect non-feminist progressives to the women’s movement. The ‘dilli walli’ feminist no longer intimidates. Has there been a change in idiom - are ‘dilli walli’ feminists (which Saheli represents) really imbibing the changes that feminisms across the country are inspiring?”
        <br><br>
        <b>Hasina</b> from Awaaz-e-Niswan and Forum, Mumbai made a strong case for Saheli to extend support to Muslim women’s issues. “It is a responsibility to see that after 25 years, has our movement touched on the issues of Muslim women?”
        <br><br>
        <b>Ranjana</b>, sharing her political confusion, said, “I feel increasingly the sense of the world changing – sense of devastating changes. Watching TV, the soap operas etc...the early fervour I felt – where my feet would not touch the ground in my enthusiasm, I now feel the ground is being pulled from under my feet. Recently in Delhi – lakhs of people have been displaced due to factory closures and evictions. I shared with Uma that a well known male progressive had made a very good presentation. She said – this is the sexual division of labour! They can be experts on one thing, but we have to be everywhere – against communalism, militarisation, raise the women’s question everywhere. The challenges before us are much more than we can conceptualise or theorise or even talk of it. We need to take stock of them. It would not be honest to not share that today I am feeling lost.”
        <br><br>
        Congratulating Saheli for being ‘Old and Gold’, <b>Naseem</b> from Action India said that today was a learning experience to get a sense of history of the women’s movement.
        <br><br>
        Said <b>Manoranjan Mohanty</b>, professor at Delhi University, “It’s an absolutely wonderful occasion. I have been absolutely outraged in the last few months after Kalinganagar killings and Salwa Judum, but moments like this give me strength. I am the beneficiary of the movement – of groups like Saheli and PUDR. Saheli is a defining symbol of the women’s movement. A particular characteristic of such autonomous and political people’s movement like Saheli is that it discovers dimensions of domination and oppression hitherto not known. And that has been the contribution of the women’s movement. And the methodological and theoretical contribution is that we still don’t know all dimensions of oppression. Three cheers to Saheli.”
        <br><br>
        “Congrats and best wishes from Stree Adhikar Sanghatan,” greeted <b>Anjali</b>, who has been a friend of Saheli since her days of working in Uttar Pradesh.
        <br><br>
        <b>Chandra Kanjilal</b>, an old associate of Saheli, now in Andhra Pradesh, remarked that it was wonderful to see so many new faces, and suggested that Saheli use this platform to network throughout the country to look at rights/livelihoods issues of rural women.
        <br><br>
        <b>Gouri</b> wondered aloud if Action India, which was soon to celebrate 30 years of existence, could give the same richness that Saheli has been able to give. “But all morning, I have been feeling envious, frankly. Truly. I wonder why can we not replicate the kind of relationships we had in Saheli? I don’t think such a thing is possible in an NGO. Why it is not possible I can’t say. But it is true that that kind of sisterhood is not there. And I have really been feeling very envious. So I will come on Saturday. Again. Who am I to congratulate, when I am a founding member of Saheli?!” Gouri also added that she did not leave Saheli, but was told to choose between Saheli and Action India. “The split in Saheli should never have happened. The work with grassroots through Action India is also needed. These activists also need paid work. Question is how to combine these politically. Would like Sabla Sangh to reconnect with Saheli. How to widen it? The Mahila Panchayat network, and the other women leaders though in NGOs, are talking about women’s issues. My request is – can Jagori, Action India, Sabla Sangh, Saheli take the lead and celebrate March 8th?”

        <b>Vidya</b> from Sabla Sangh, admitted that when some Sahelis had come to interview them, she fought! “When we have been working together since 1984, why are we divided? You people are working in the air – unless you join with the grassroots and work, how can we bring feminism? How can the flames of feminism be fanned and spread?,” she asked passionately.
        <br><br>
        The song by Sabla Sangh: “Mein Tum Ko Vishwas Doon, Tum Mujh Ko Vishwas Do…” had everyone clapping to the beat.
        <br><br>
        Lunch was the next item on the agenda, and everyone went out to eat the excellent poori, aloo sabzi, pulav, raita and gulab jamun. Wandering around, reading the excerpts of interviews on the walls, catching up with old friends, exclaiming over how long it had been...it could have gone on forever. But the audience was coaxed into the hall for an afternoon of serious discussion.

        <i>Yes, we lost equipment, furniture, doors and windows, we lost books, published material documenting our ideas, debates and struggles, we lost our hand written notes to each other, we lost many important documents and many other things in the fire that engulfed Saheli office on that unbelievable morning of 13 May 2011 when a fire raged through the Defence Colony Flyover Market in New Delhi, reducing about 60 establishments to cinders. But what we have not lost is the fire inside us and the spirit to move forward.</i>
        <br><br>
        It was in the early hours of morning when we heard that there was a fire in the market. Doubtful of the intensity, certain that nothing but marginal damage could have occurred, we rushed to the office, thinking all the time about who could reach faster, who had the key to enter and assess the damage… but we found nothing but gaping holes where once there had been doors. Soot and smoke and black sludge as the firemen worked their way around the fire till late in the evening. Embers rising into small fires intermittently through the day. And through it all, our eager eyes searching to understand the damage, seeking what could be salvaged.
        <br><br>
        No doubt it has been devastating to see our colourful, 27 year old office, our walls, cupboards, filing cabinets, documents, files, reports and other publications, reduced to soot and ash… everything turned into shades of black. But over these last few weeks, we have been trying to come to terms with this ‘event’ in the life of Saheli and move on. Material that could be saved in whatever state it was, is being sorted and stored, some very basic repair of the office is already finished and we are soon hoping that it will be in some shape so we can use it for a while, till repair work from Public Works Department (PWD) gets over and we can think of a more permanent renovation of the office… but all this will take maybe six months or more.
        <br><br>
        As we chug along with various tasks that need to be done before we can get back to our ‘real’ work as activists, we are also dealing with our small/big but precious losses within this collective loss. The hand written minutes books and daily dairies, saved for 30 years, detailing... the political and personal journeys we’ve all made are the ones we will miss the most. These are documents that can never be recreated. Though we have managed to save some, most is lost… and rest we are hoping will not disintegrate with time… half burnt and smudged with water as they are.
        <br><br>
        We will also miss all those letters and cards we used to get each year on Saheli day… in addition to all the small notes and messages we left in the  daily diary… loves, fights, fall-outs and make ups documented to reflect that ‘we feminists are human too’!
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">Many hands holding it all up</b>
        <br><br>
        But through all the loss, the support that we have received in the last few weeks has been incredible, amazing, humbling… and that’s what has kept us going.
        <br><br>
        On that ‘fiery day’, as we like to remember it, as word of the disaster spread, along with many past, present and future Sahelis like Divya, Sree, Vani, Shweta, Sadhna, Ramani, Nalini, Janaki, Jaishree, Savita; a lot of others friends and supporters like Pooja, Rudra, Shomona, Suro, Gurjeet, Param and Pamela; Mukesh from Hazards Centre; Mario, Shalini, Anusha and Shubham from Nigah; Preeti, Anupriya from Jagori; Jaya from Nirantar; Sarojini, Binu, Anjali and Deepa from Sama… all showed up to help in whatever way they could. To hold our hand as we gazed upon the devastation in front of us, to share our shock, to weep with us, to determinedly start working our way through the rubble to salvage files, reports, almirahs… anything that could be saved, working tirelessly in that smoke filled office by torches and candlelight.
        <br><br>
        Messages from friends and co-travellers poured in from wherever in the country or the globe they were at that point of time. Others showed up with food, water and love. Still others rushed to save the photographs from the red cupboard (and yes they did manage to save quite some!) And when we were too tired to handle any more soot filled, ash-ridden papers and ready to throw them all out to the kabadiwala, others quietly set us aside and made decisions on what must be preserved, or what decisions to discard must be delayed. Individuals, friends from other women’s groups, members of other NGOs, old Sahelis and new… on that very day, thanks to help from all of you, we managed to store and dry and stack our things in the office of Partners for Law in Development (PLD) in nearby Jangpura, a friend, Kajal’s basement in Nizamuddin and Ranjana’s garage. A ’Thank you’ is simply not enough!
        <br><br>
        In addition to the people who showed up that day, we have also had many emails and phone calls  from fellow feminists, comrades and friends expressing their grief... for us and also for themselves – for their own relationships with Saheli the group, the space, the idea.
        <br><br>
        <img src="${r2FetchArticleImgURL}Article3/2.png" style="width: 100%; display: block; padding-top: 5px;" />
        <br><br>
        So the last few weeks, have been a tizzy. Kalpana, Satnam and Janaki dashing to banks and chasing the accountant. Vani, Deepti and Kalpana finding structural engineers and people in PWD to evaluate the place. Jaishree, Nalini, Savita, Nidhi, Deepti and Sadhna running in circles around electricians and masons. Satnam meticulously keeping records of donations and receipts. Vineeta holding up the e-end of things and keeping everyone informed. Teena, Kriti, Harshita, Sadhna, Prabhat, Maya, Radha, Deepti, Lata, Rahul, Akshara, Shubham, Charan, Sophie, Anjali, Myna, Nandini, Susanna (NTUI), Elakshi, Shalini and so many more relentlessly breathing the soot-filled air and braving the exhausting summer heat as they separated documents destroyed by the fire or the water from the tenders, from those that can still be read/ stored/ handled!
        <br><br>
        In addition, many more Sahelis like Shweta, Ranjana,  Ashima,  Laxmi ,  Nilanjana and Davi have been offering to take on specifics tasks like making an inventory of  material  and raising funds, etc.  And at  this point ,  how can we not  mention the amazing support  we have got  from Dalip, Shaheen and Suresh of  Deez Biryani  just below our office!
        <br><br><br>
        <b style="font-weight: 700;">An afternoon of collective energy, ideas, songs and determination!</b>
        <br><br>
        Saheli had to move on. We thought that the best way for us to do this would be to actually reclaim the office with friends old and new for an afternoon of some singing, talking, chai and samosas under the flyover!
        <br><br>
        So we invited our friends and supporters to come to Saheli on 28th May 2011... “to talk, to share, to sing, to feel our loss, to feel our strength together, to float ideas on how to plan for that mountain of a task called ‘rebuilding’ and even how we could collectively re-imagine those two rooms anew!”
        <br><br>
        Before people came, a major clean up of the office was done, we hired fans, durries and chairs from a tent house. We hung fancy, colourful fairy lights on the frame of the false ceiling that was hanging burnt, from the roof! We even got a new Saheli name board! As people started dropping in, we almost forgot the circumstances under which we were meeting… it seemed like any other Saheli event (only better organised!)… warm, crowded, noisy… all of us, together again!
        <br><br>
        <img src="${r2FetchArticleImgURL}Article3/3.png" style="width: 100%; display: block; padding-top: 5px;" />
        <br><br>
        Starting with songs, many of those who came spoke as to what Saheli as a space has meant to them. The song <i>…mein zindagi ka saath nibhata chala gaya… har fikr ko dhuyen mein udata chala gaya…</i> was sung with amusement at its pertinence to the moment.  Amidst fun and humour and feeling of togetherness we went on to discuss some practical things too. We talked about the issues of repairs within the office and dealing with government departments like PWD, MTNL and other agencies like the BSES, etc. and the need for human and financial resources. Many came with ideas as to how to start with the process of rebuilding and also volunteered to give time for anything from sitting in the office for repairs to sorting, to actually running around the government offices. Needless to say, the afternoon was light, full of humour…simply electrifying! And that’s just what we needed because the very next day, repair work was started in the office, the false ceiling frame was pulled down and used to make a door for the office, and we got temporary walls built to cover the space that was left after the broken down windows and the plumbing was repaired, amongst many other small, small things.
        <br><br>
        We are hopeful that in the coming weeks, we’ll have some basics in place so we’ll be able to use the office soon. We have already started opening the place for our Wednesday meetings and Saturdays.

                    Oh, famed red file and white chair from our very first office, we used you and often just abused you … you were a constant presence at all our meetings… many a times you protested and wanted to be ‘set free’ but every time some Saheli or the other pulled you out of the dustbin or from the kabariwala’s stack. Goodbye beloveds, rest easy or whatever it is that a file and a chair are supposed to do!
                    <br><br>
                    You six young wall mounted fans had the big responsibility of keeping us hot headed Sahelis cool! We marvelled at how you moved around every time we pulled a string… wishfully thinking how wonderful if you could turn the same magic to stir the many other things we are constantly trying to move, at the pull of a string! Now you are gone and a new pedestal fan is trying to take your place. Beware, fading memory!

                    A blue fridge with an identity crisis was the storer of many a packets of chips, mithai, roohafza and keys! When we first gifted you to ourselves in 2005, it brought much joy and cheers to the lives of sweat-drenched and heat-hit Sahelis. Breaking down was not an option because you had overheard the fate of the previous fridge that was turned into a file storage cabinet! But, no matter how badly we treated you, you never once protested! How ironic that you, the maker of ice, melted.

        <br><br>
        The red laminate had sizzled to a crisp, but shades of it still peeped through the black crust. The cupboard is opened tentatively. A hand goes in to explore in the dark. Shelves and shelves of hardened spines. Amid them a cool, soft package. Pudgy, synthetic.  We step out into the balcony to see what’s in it. A safe, clean packet of sanitary towels. Periods, anyone?
        <br><br>
        In another old wooden shelf, remnant of an officious table that once occupied a large part of the office, we struggle to open a drawer. Inside, everything looks glisteningly new and clean (all things being relative, you see!). An untouched roll of scotch tape… still sticky and workable, tumbles out... mocking us?! Or was it the good-as-new red and black marker pens that were having the last laugh?
        <br><br>
        Out of an old Burma teak box, our stock of posters largely survives relentless water-hosing by the firemen. Saved by a mattress which used to be on top of it. As we sort, out come a set of colourful masks – from the queer pride march last year!
        <br><br>
        And then, we venture into the toilet, built in 1995 after many years of feminist practice of holding bladders and suchlikes. The roof is burnt. The walls are fragile. The water tank has melted, as has the flush tank. But behold the green and white buckets and mug! Pristine. Glistening. Survivors.

We in the queer community understand how valuable such spaces are to us. It’s terrible that Delhi has lost the space and history which Saheli holds.

        Can a movement be gutted by a fire? Can a collective be gutted by a fire? Can our space/s be gutted by a fire? Definitely not. On the contrary, the fact that recorded memories are gutted by the fire may provide an opportunity for all or force all Sahelis and the rest of us to reflect and jog memories and put down a history/her stories together looking back from where we stand today rather than merely a static history or just moving on and on.

        All of us out-of-towners awaiting orders from under the flyover.. yes, it still exists..charred maybe, but bouncing back. I am sure it is still too overwhelming to plan and delegate tasks, but the sooner that happens, the sooner the momentum will carry the organization forward. The support pouring in is so heartwarming...

        ... so I was wondering if we could use this moment, all of us, particularly those who remember the early history of Saheli, its campaigns, its publications, to record in writing or on tape, what we remember, to do it individually and collectively, and to make this then part of Saheli’s new archive - a remembered history, but a history nonetheless.

        For many of us Saheli has been a space which nurtured us, and also which has been such an integral part of the Women’s movement. Yes, the loss of documents means the loss of a generation of activism’s records. Well, one needs to look at it perhaps philosophically. Saheli lives on in the hearts and minds of so many. You people have a tough task at hand...

        Yesterday at Saheli was wonderful; before we change its look back to a Saheli office we really should do a disco party since it looks like a very stylish New York bar at the moment and that too will pass into history— pretty soon we hope when we repair the premises.
